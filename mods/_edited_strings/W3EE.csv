2116942609|00000000||Werewolves are active at night, particularly when the moon is full. Though they hunt alone, when threatened they will summon wolves to aid them. Werewolves rarely feel the need to flee, for few adversaries put up much of a fight against them. They strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors that easily shred even heavy armor; a witcher would thus be wise to avoid getting hit altogether and equip lighter armor. A man cursed with lycanthropy grows fur all over his body, fur that can be easily set aflame by Igni or Dancing Star. For a creature its size it can be easily bled and injured, a silver blade coated in either brown oil or Falka's blood will thus prove effective.<br><br>A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must therefore equip himself with a great deal of patience.<br><br><i>"If you stay at a medium distance of a werewolf, it will usually try to close the gap with an easily dodgeable jumping attack. Werewolves are quick to retaliate after they get struck, anticipate this and be ready to riposte after each one of your strikes."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher	
2116942610|00000000||Regardless of color, all archespores fight using similar methods: attacking with powerful, jaw-like leaves. If their victim is out of reach, they can also spray caustic acid which, if it makes any contact whatsoever with the skin, can provoke a reaction similar to that caused by severe poisoning; remedy this with a dose of golden oriole.<br><br>Like other plants, archespores thrive in sunlight and are significantly more ferocious on sunny noons. Archespores luckily also share a plant's weaknesses, and are extremely vulnerable to fire, which is one of the most effective methods of fighting them. Archespores do not like strong vibrations, which cause them to flee underground at once. Make no mistake: despite being a plant in almost every way, their nature is that of a cursed creature and silver weaponry should be used to combat archespores.
2116942611|00000000||Basilisks love dark, damp places such as cellars, caves and city sewers. They hunt by day, waiting patiently in hiding for their prey to come, then jump out in a flash to unleash a deadly attack.<br><br>When preparing to fight such a creature one should drink golden oriole, which will provide resistance to its venom; also prepare northern wind and rime oil, for frostbite easily settles in the moist skin of the basilisk. Keep the basilisk grounded with the sign of Aard or a crossbow bolt.<br><br>Basilisk leather is a highly-valued material used to make fashionable shoes and women's handbags. For this reason many men, their courage girded by goldlust, take to hunting them. Most of these hunts end in disaster, but some do manage to bag their prey, which has led to a drastic decline in this creature's numbers in recent years. Some mages and druids are of the opinion that basilisks should be included in programs meant to safeguard dying species. Everyone else thinks those mages and druids have gone completely mad.
2116942612|00000000||Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements. Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor.<br><br>Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wing and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. Blows from their beaks are especially dangerous, as they aim with deadly precision at exposed flesh and vital organs and leave bleeding, life-threatening wounds. When fighting them one should make liberal use of dancing star, whose fire will light their feathers with ease, as well as flammable oil which makes immolation possible again after searing all the feathers off.<br><br>Like most large flyers, the cockatrice has trouble maneuvering on the ground. Exploit this by staying in their blind spot with an aggressive fighting style.<br><br><i>"A cockatrice will launch itself at you if you keep your distance. When you see it standing on its two feet, be ready to cast Igni to interrupt this attack. Don’t tire yourself out with other signs, it'll leave you exhausted when it launches this near undodgeable attack... "</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942613|00000000||Forktails are active by day. They usually hunt alone or, more rarely, in pairs. They attack big game, including domesticated animals, mainly cattle and pigs, and even humans from time to time.<br><br>Like all draconids their massive size does not stop them from flying and attacking from the air. They use their weight and height advantage as they swoop down to knock their prey over with their wings. Forktails have a thick hide and a witcher should use a particularly sharp blade coated in corrosive oil or imbue their weapon with the rune of Svarog when dealing with these creatures. Once on the ground, they are equally dangerous, with the deadly combination of armor rending attacks and high mobility.
2116942614|00000000||A wyvern will usually attack from the air, aiming to knock its prey down with its wings. After landing it will attack with its tooth-filled beak, trying to draw attention away from its most dangerous weapon: the stinger found at the end of its long tail. A strike from this carries the risk of poisoning from powerful toxins. Even a witcher's body experiences wrenching pain when injected with wyvern venom, and so it is worthwhile preparing oneself with suitable potions ahead of time. As for the wyvern's weaknesses, it is susceptible to frost, thus rime oil will prove effective when facing these creatures.<br><br><i>"Unlike most large flyers, the wyvern's capabilities are limited if you keep your distance. Performing long attacks and backing away is an effective method of fighting these creatures." </i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942615|00000000||Slyzards are keenly aggressive and attack from both ground and air. Their goal during a fight is to get close enough to their foe to injure it with a breath of fire or knock it down with a sonic blast. Like wyverns, slyzards also attack with venom-spiked tails.<br><br>Slyzards like to disengage mid-fight to fly into the air and plummet down at high speed while spewing out balls of fire.<br><br>Right before these igneous missiles emerge, you can observe a fiery ball forming in the monster’s maw. While airborne, a slyzard can also attack with its claws and teeth.<br><br>It is worthwhile to employ the Aard sign or a crossbow bolt to force slyzards to the ground. Slyzards rely on their body heat, and while their hide can still protect them against the flash freezing effect of the Northern Wind bomb, a sword infused with Zoria or coated in rime oil can severely damage their delicate thermostasis.
2116942616|00000000||<i>”The pitcher emitted a puff of glowing red smoke. The smoke pulsated, then gathered into an irregular sphere floating in front of the poet's head...”</i><br>–The First Longing, a Tale Fantastic in All Ways<br><br>A djinn is a powerful air spirit, a condensation of the power of said element endowed with consciousness and character - the latter usually nasty. According to legend, djinns can grant even the most far-fetched wishes, though they do so begrudgingly. <br><br>Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings. A mage who succeeds in doing so can then draw energy from such a spirit, using it to cast spells without having to summon the Power from traditional sources. Only a handful have ever managed this feat, however, for djinns fight to avoid such a fate with stubborn determination. To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will, one must first weaken it - and that is no easy task. <br><br>Fighting djinns is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could never master with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating the element of air they can summon gales, powerful storms, even hurricanes. Little is known about fighting djinns with ordinary means. Silver hurts them, as well as veil oil - yet there are no known swordsmen who have slain a djinn unaided by sorcerers.
2116942617|00000000||Earth elementals can withstand a tremendous amount of punishment. Due to their enormous mass they are virtually impossible to knock off balance. They do not bleed nor do they feel any pain from poison or fire. <br><br>They kill men with astonishing ease – whether by smashing them with their fists or hurling enormous stones at them.<br><br>As with all elemental constructs, an earth elemental can be disabled by severing the magical tethers between the elemental and the stone that houses it. The tethers can be directly disrupted with the sign of Yrden or a blade coated in veil oil. If neither are at hand, brute force can be used effectively by simply shattering the stone with strong blows or grapeshot. Like all magics, the spell that binds the elemental will become considerably stronger when moon and stars are vissible. 
2116942618|00000000||These elementals attack using fireballs and streams of flame which reduce anything in their path to ashes in the blink of an eye. Like golems and other elementals, poison does not touch them nor do they bleed. Fire-based spells not only do no harm but in fact strengthen them - thus one should by no means think of striking them with Igni. Getting within sword's reach of the elementals is dangerous due to the furnace-like heat they emanate. One should thus strike with Aard or use frost-spewing northern wind and dimeritium bombs to douse their flames. Just like golems, the fire elemental is magic tethered to a construct. To disable the construct the tethers must thus be broken; this can be done by sufficiently damaging the stone that houses the elemental, or by damaging the tethers directly with the sign of Yrden or a blade coated in veil oil.
2116942619|00000000||Gargoyles are extremely dangerous opponents. Carved from granite or marble, they are able to withstand tremendous amounts of damage and exhibit superhuman strength. One blow dealt from their boulder-like fists will crush even a man clad in heavy armor. Not even those out of reach of a gargoyle's arms can feel safe, for they are able to throw hunks of stone with deadly precision. <br><br>Due to gargoyles' considerable size and weight, the Aard sign does nothing against them. As beings made of stone, they feel no pain from fire, meaning the Igni sign is also worthless against them, as are weapons meant to cause bleeding or poisoning. It is a witcher’s good fortune that they also have a few weaknesses: they can be shattered with Svarog runes and rending attacks, more easily so after first weakening their housing with corrosive oil. Yrden and veil oil can also be used to disrupt the workings of the magic spell which gives them life.
2116942620|00000000||Defeating a golem is extraordinarily difficult. For obvious reasons it does not bleed; it feels no fear or mercy and it is invulnerable to fire and poison. Moreover, a golem's body is as hard as the rock it is sometimes heft out of; a plain sword will not hurt it. A witcher must utilize grapeshot bombs of superior quality and focus his strikes in strong rending blows. A sword imbued with the Svarog rune or coated in corrosive oil is invaluable in these fights. <br><br>Golems use no weapons, for they have no need – their fists, weighing over a hundred pounds each, can crush solid granite with one hit. A blow from a golem should thus be avoided at all costs – there is no shield that can stop it, no sword that can parry it. This is no easy task for these creatures are able to move with surprising speed. Luckily their enormous mass means they are not very agile – once a golem begins a charge, it cannot stop quickly - a fact experienced witchers use to their advantage. <br><br>Their magical nature makes them considerably tougher at night under the stars, but also leaves them vulnerable to the sign of Yrden and blades coated in veil oil.
2116942621|00000000||The Hounds' chief weapons are their claws and teeth. Their battle tactics rely on knocking their opponents to the ground before tearing them to shreds. Badly wounded Hounds fall into a kind of frenzy which adds to their deadly might. These beasts also use their powers over the cold to freeze the ground around them and create sharp spikes of ice. Creatures born of frost, they feel pain from the Igni sign, and there is also reason to believe Axii can momentarily weaken their drive to kill and somewhat weaken these fierce foes. <br><br>The Hounds' icy nature also means they can draw strength from extreme cold. Therefore one should be particularly on guard when fighting them during blizzards or in glacial regions. Elven legends likewise claim they gain strength when a red moon - a known herald of the Hunt's arrival - hangs in the sky.
2116942622|00000000||Ice elementals have no qualms about carrying out this order nor any particular difficulty in doing so. Gifted with the incredible strength to crush even those clad in plate, and with permafrost-like hardness. Altogether incredibly difficult opponents, a witcher’s only chance at tipping the scales towards victory is to interfere with the workings of the spell that gives this creature life. This can be done with a blade coated in veil oil or the sign of Yrden. Beyond that, Igni, grapeshot of superior quality, and rending attacks are effective.
2116942623|00000000||Griffins mate for life and when their partner is attacked they will defend them until death. For this reason they are often considered the embodiment of courage, loyalty and fighting spirit. This last attribute no one would deny them – when provoked, they will not cease their attack until they have torn their opponent to shreds. <br><br>Griffins find their victims using their extraordinarily perceptive sense of smell. After drawing near to their chosen target they attack by swooping down from great heights. Their muscular mass combined with their great speed mean this blow alone is often enough to end the fight. If, however, the victim survives this aerial assault, the griffin will immediately engage it in close combat, making use of its sharp, curved beak and powerful talons that rip through armor.<br><br>The wounds it dispenses are deep and cause powerful bleeding. Griffins themselves have a thick hide, but are covered in fur and feathers which can be easily set aflame with Dancing Star or Igni. Strong rending strikes should be used to slay griffins.<br><br>Griffins have a surprisingly delicate toxic balance in their bodies. While their bile is a miasma powerful enough to kill most smaller creatures, their bloodflow is easily upset by foreign toxins. Thus blades coated in poisonous oil will prove very effective when fighting griffins.<br><br><i>"On the ground, they have trouble maneuvering. Exploit this by bending your strikes around the griffin, striking it in the back. Keep dancing around the griffin in this manner, then make it back off with the Igni sign while you catch your breath."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942624|00000000||Harpy nests are most often found atop high cliffs or rocky ravines. Sure signs of having strayed near one are crumbling human remains and animal carcasses, guano-streaked rocks and feathers littering the ground.<br><br>Harpies and shishigas hunt in flocks consisting of a handful to up to twenty individuals. Though rather cowardly and cautious, harpies fiercely defend their nests and will not hesitate to attack when outnumbering their foes. <br><br>During combat they use their flying ability to dive swiftly and strike their victims one by one before soaring back up out of reach. They can kill with their wings or their sharp beak and talons. Once on the ground they move slowly and clumsily, and thus no longer present much of a threat. Their skin is thin and frail, so fast strikes should be preferred over force.
2116942625|00000000||When they spy a potential victim, erynias, like harpies or shishigas, will try to make full use of the strength of their numbers and their ability to control the skies. They will circle above their prey and then attack from several directions at once, striking with razor-sharp talons and tearing their targets into shreds. <br><br>While attacking they aim for the neck, eyes and other vital organs, often causing their prey to bleed to death as a result. In this way a small flock of erynias is able to make quick work of larger and better-armed victims, who often are not able to defend themselves effectively from several opponents attacking at once.<br><br>Erynias are frail creatures, easily injured by fast and accurate strikes, especially when done so with a blade coated in Falka's blood.
2116942626|00000000||One legend claims that sirens and lamias were once friendly towards men – and supposedly were even known (albeit on rare occasions) to accept some sailors' clumsy attempts at courtship. In our day, however, they are decidedly aggressive, perhaps soured by the numerous kidnappings carried out by frustrated sea salts. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: nowadays these monsters display no signs of good will and so when spotting them one should immediately reach for one's sword. <br><br>Sirens and lamias (the sirens' more dangerous cousins) usually hunt in flocks, making use of their numbers as well as their ability to move effortlessly through water and air. <br><br>On the ground, however, they are virtually defenseless, and so a wise tactic is to damage their fin-like wings to force them to land with a crossbow. Being aquatic, sirens are often drenched, something a cunning witcher can exploit with the northern wind bomb or rime oil. Threatened or injured sirens will let out a terrifying shriek, leaving their opponents stunned while they escape – and their sisters swoop down for an easy attack.	
2116942627|00000000||Succubi and menads can usually be found near human settlements, including small villages and populous cities. They prowl at night, though when stricken by severe need they will leave their lairs during the day as well. They shower their affections on men as well as women, the young as well as the old, the ugly as well as the beautiful. Some of them are particularly fond of pastors and other holy men, whose seduction they treat as a sort of game.<br><br>Though succubi are peaceful by nature, when forced to fight they will defend themselves fiercely. One should thus not be fooled by their fair appearance – under the velvety skin of their arms lie muscles of iron, and a blow delivered with their rear, goat-like legs or the thick horns on their head can easily crush bone.
2116942628|00000000||An armored arachas is a true behemoth. It uses its enormous mass to knock over and trample its victims then devours their crushed remains. Like all arachasae, it is highly venomous, and thus golden oriole should always be consumed before fighting it.<br><br>It is also worthwhile to stock up on healing potions and crossbow bolts before setting out, for this arachas' thick plating can withstand a great deal of damage, making battles with it a long and exhausting affair. Use fast strikes with a blade coated in corrosive oil to weaken its carapace, then employ heavy rending strikes to break through.<br><br><i>"When you find an opening, two successive heavy slashes easily cripple any from the arachasae family."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942629|00000000||Venomous arachasae produce colossal amounts of this toxin and deploy it during combat in many ways. Before striking, a venomous arachas will cover its pincers and teeth with a thick coating of this deadly liquid, it will then squirt the venom at its opponent to weaken it, and once locked in direct combat, will continue spraying the noxious ooze all around itself, meaning every breath brings its victim closer to death. Like other members of this species, venomous arachasae use prehensile feelers to grab and immobilize their prey. When attempting to fight such a creature a witcher should drink golden oriole, which will reduce his body's vulnerability to poison, and then weaken it from a safe distance with a crossbow or bombs before striking it with strong blows from the sides and back.
2116942630|00000000||Killing an arachnomorph is no easy task, but there are two approaches which stand a chance of succeeding: due to the astonishing speed with which an arachnomorph can move, there is no point in chasing it – better instead to choose an advantageous position and wait for it to strike. The beast will most often attempt a surprise attack, throwing a web at its prey which will leave the entangled victim barely able to parry blows, let alone strike ones of its own. One should thus strive to attack an arachnomorph when it steps back to start weaving its web, seizing this moment of vulnerability before it is too late.<br><br>Arachnomorphs suffer the effects of most witcher signs: they can be trapped with Yrden and the Axii sign can also be used to momentarily neutralize them. Arachnomorphs are also sensitive to fire, but a witcher should focus his strength on the Yrden and Axii signs, instead utilizing dancing star to lay fields of fire.<br><br>One must be exceedingly careful when fighting an arachnomorph colossus – such a beast needs no time to weave a new web, having within its sacs a virtually limitless supply of silk. It can also jump great distances to pin its victim to the ground. Only the Yrden sign can hope to slow it.
2116942631|00000000||Endrega drones live but brief lives, the culmination of which comes in the autumn when they fertilize the queen. They pass the time leading up to that moment by protecting the colony's territory. Weaker drones die in these battles, while the largest and strongest survive. These select individual‘s genes are passed down to the next generation of endregae, while they themselves are killed after fertilization takes place and their bodies used to feed the hive during the long winter months.<br><br>Drones are easy to identify due to their distinctive, cone-shaped abdomens. Unlike other endregae they can attack from a distance, sending out volleys of poisoned quills. As with all of their kind, attempting to inflict bleeding is futile. Like its cousins, the worker and the warrior, the drone has a thick carapace that requires strong blows to break. <br><br><i>"In a fight against multiple types of endregae, the drone will usually stay back and fire at a threat while other endrega swarm it. golden oriole comes in handy in such situations as the witcher can focus his full attention on... not getting swarmed."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942632|00000000||An endrega warrior's main weapon is its long tail, which is tipped with a club-like growth and spiked with venomous quills. Powerful abdominal muscles allow it to swing this tail with enough force to kill even armored opponents in one blow. <br><br>Endrega warriors also use their mass and strength as a weapon by charging their opponents in an attempt to knock them over. As invertebrates with powerful sectioned carapaces, endrega warriors do not bleed profusely. The carapace itself, however, can be weakened with corrosive oil.
2116942633|00000000||Endrega workers are most often found traveling in groups of a half-dozen or more members. They move slowly, yet when attacking they are capable of covering the distance to their victim in the blink of an eye. Like all of their kind, endrega workers are highly venomous. Their bite is toxic, as are any wounds dealt by the bony growths on the ends of their limbs. They can also spew acid to great effect from a distance of several paces. Their usual tactic is to surround their enemy and attack him from several sides at once. Like all insectoids they do not suffer particularly from bleeding, yet their carapaces are susceptible to corrosive oil. Endrega workers use their claws to dig out vast tunnels, and they use these tools to cut straight through steel armor.
2116942634|00000000||The greatest obstacle when fighting giant centipedes is their thick armor, which deflects most blows not only from weapons, but also from magical means – such as those dealt by simple spells or witcher signs.<br><br>When attacked with a weapon, they will often parry the strike, then quickly reply with their own forceful counter. Thus, the best method for fighting them is to catch them in an Yrden trap, keeping them from protecting themselves with their armor or from burrowing into the ground.
2116942635|00000000||Kikimore warriors defend their nests from attackers. They attack somewhat slower than kikimore workers. They are able to spew streams of caustic venom a great distance and leap to attack. This venom is highly unique in that it very similar properties as the toxic witcher potions, and can thus be remedied with a dose of white honey or avoided in the first place with the Quen sign. They are covered with thick, hard armor which easily deflects blows from even the sharpest sword.<br><br>Kikimore warriors are protected by swarms of workers which obey their orders until they are themselves eradicated.<br><br>They are completely immune to the effects of the Axii sign and most other signs, and should instead be fought off with heavy rending blows dealt with a sword.
2116942636|00000000||Kikimore workers obey orders given by kikimore warriors. On command, a swarm of workers might begin burrowing tunnels near potential prey to allow for a surprise mass attack. Eliminate the warrior guiding a swarm, however, and the workers will disperse and cease digging.<br><br>Kikimore workers are nimbler and quicker than warriors.<br><br>They show complete immunity to the Axii sign, and when they dig tunnels, they are invulnerable to all the other signs as well. Poison also does them no harm.<br><br>The Quen sign will protect against the kikimore's venom, which has a similar effect to the toxicity of witcher potions and can thus be remedied with a dosage of white honey or through deep meditation.
2116942638|00000000||Ghouls and their more dangerous cousins, graveirs, usually feed in small groups, at times led by an alghoul. Since they delight most in the taste of fresh carcasses, they appear wherever newly-dug graves are to be found: cemeteries, crypts, catacombs and battlefields. Whenever the opportunity arises they hunt the living as well, especially when they have strength in numbers.<br><br>In a one-on-one fight with a trained witcher, a ghoul poses little threat, but one must remember that wounded individuals can erupt in a mad frenzy. At such times they attack fiercely, paying no heed to their own safety and brushing off all wounds. One must likewise bear in mind that ghouls and graveirs are particular dangerous around dusk and at night. Ghouls have long claws that they use to pry open caskets or the armor of a freshly deceased soldier on the battlefield. Despite sharp claws, they have dull minds that are easily muddled with the Axii sign. Their hide is easily lacerated, so a fast attack style should be employed. 
2116942637|00000000||Once native to the far south, this invasive species migrated north over the course of decades, adjusting as it went to new climates and temperatures. It found damp woodlands and swamps most hospitable and made them its home, making use of the muck and moss found there as blankets during its winter hibernation. The arachas hides its unprotected, sack-like abdomen under a covering of hollow tree-trunks worn on its back.<br><br>At first glance, a stationary arachas often looks like a part of the forest undergrowth, a fact it uses to deadly advantage when hunting. It usually begins a battle by spitting venom, then tries to grab its prey with prehensile feelers in order to drag it within reach of its crushing pincers.
2116942639|00000000||Ghouls seem to possess wits enough to at least know a brighter mind when they see it, and so let alghouls and cemetaurs lead their packs. A pack so led will terrorize all in its path, attacking not only lone travelers but also caravans and even farmsteads. When encountering such a pack the alghoul should be eliminated as a first priority, leaving the other beasts for once their leader is gone. One should be particularly careful when fighting alghouls around dusk and at night, when they fight with doubled strength.<br><br>During combat alghouls and cemetaurs try risky maneuvers aimed at knocking their opponents to the ground so the others can finish the job by tearing them to shreds. Like a normal ghoul, alghouls have sharp claws and can fall into a frenzy when injured and attack with blind fury. An experienced witcher knows to get out of its way on such occasions and strike from behind, while for an inexperienced witcher, such a turn of events often marks the end of his Path.
2116942640|00000000||Rotfiends and devourers were once rarities, but in the present age of constant warfare and violence they have become a veritable plague, particularly around battlefields and in disease-stricken areas. Though they feed mainly on carrion, they will at times attack the living. They usually feed in large groups and thus present a danger to lone travelers – especially considering their speed, which is more than a match for a horse at full gallop.<br><br>The rotfiend's decomposing body is filled with gasses which are poisonous even to those who, like witchers, are immune to most other toxins. These emissions are also highly flammable, meaning any spark, not to mention a carelessly-cast Igni sign, can lead to an explosion. Ranged weaponry can be used to make the rotfiend blow up in the middle of his group. This is particularly likely after a rotfiend dies, when its body thrashes around in uncontrollable tremors. In case he stands in close quarters, a witcher should protect himself from such an explosion with the Quen sign.<br><br>Rotfiends and devourers feed in the twilight hours and at night, when they become much more dangerous than during the day.
2116942641|00000000||Like so many other beliefs about monsters, this one is false. While drowners do look like humans from a distance, witchers, who have the dubious pleasure of examining them from close quarters, have reported the numerous ways in which their anatomy differs from our own. Their scaly skin, gills and dorsal fins suggest drowners and their like are an entirely foreign species.<br><br>The adaptations mentioned above make drowners excellent swimmers, well-suited to the muddy waters of the ponds and lakes in which they dwell. They often cluster near human settlements, which are for them an excellent source of food.<br><br>Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. They can attack with lightning speed, taking their victim by surprise and pulling him into the water to drown. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are principally active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling – at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.<br><br>Drowners, mucknixers, vodniks and drowned dead all live in putrid, rotting filth, and so have developed a high resistance to poison. Though humanoid in form, they are primitive creatures no more intelligent than carp or pike. These aquatic creatures are always wet or at least damp, the freezing effects of northern wind, a blade coated in rime oil, or the Zoria rune can be used to exploit this. Note that drowners are eager to strike and will almost always attempt a predictable lunge, a witcher need but sidestep this to stay safe and leave the drowner vulnerable to retaliation.
2116942642|00000000||<br>Foglets may appear wherever thick fog can arise: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes. If no fog is forthcoming, they muster great strength to create or summon it themselves. This is a tiring act for these creatures, which a witcher can use to his advantage. Quickly thickening air undisturbed by the wind unmistakably signals a foglet is present - and preparing an attack. <br><br>Thick clouds of mist not only allow foglets to remain unseen, but also serve as their weapons. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. <br><br>Even if a traveler spies his pursuer and manages to attack, the foglet can disappear into thin air before the blade hits its target. Some foglets are additionally said to possess an ability to create complicated illusions rivaling that of human mages. Whether that is true or merely one of the dark legends men tell about these mysterious monsters remains uncertain.<br><br>When fighting foglets, a witcher must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues a witcher has to their location. Should a witcher be caught off guard, he should be protected by the sign of Quen. Should a witcher catch the shimmer of a hidden foglet, the Aard sign should be cast to cause them to become tangible, giving purchase to blades and other weapons. <br><br>"Foglets often come out of cover swinging, which will get you hit repeatedly if you aren’t prepared. A dose of black blood can help even the field if you get nicked."<br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942643|00000000||Grave hags use their tongues in combat to grab or flog their victims. Claws built for digging up buried bodies serve just as well as weapons to rend flesh. Though clumsy in appearance, grave hags move and attack at great speed – sometimes even a witcher's reflexes are too slow to avoid their blows. <br><br>Grave hags are territorial creatures. Their lairs resemble caricatures of human homes and are built near burial sites. They venture out at night to hunt, stalking straggling travelers or mourners too lost in their grief to notice the setting of the sun. On rare occasions hunger-driven grave hags will hunt during the day. They are less dangerous at such times, for sunlight weakens them considerably.
2116942644|00000000||Like drowners, with whom they often share hunting grounds, water hags and swamp bints dwell near shallow streams, rivers and wetlands. Though bulky, they are excellent swimmers. They can even swim through thick mud with astonishing agility, surfacing beside their victims to attack them with their sickle-shaped claws. They are also able to form this mud into balls, which they toss to temporarily blind opponents.<br><br>Water hags are particularly active and dangerous during rainstorms, conditions which furthermore hinder the use of the Igni sign. Instead, the shock-based sign of Quen should be utilized to both protect against the hag's attacks and retaliate with a jolt.
2116942645|00000000||Trolls are able to use fire and simple tools, and some of them have even mastered the basics of common speech. Though linguistic nuances such as conjugations and declinations escape them, they are extremely fond of riddles, rhymes and all sorts of wordplay, a fact a witcher in possession of a bit of wit can use to his advantage.<br><br>If a fight proves inevitable, one must watch out for the stones these trolls throw with great strength and shocking precision. Their powerful, heavy fists also present a danger, for they can buckle even the sturdiest breastplate or cuirass. Since their backs are covered in a layer of rocky growth, blows delivered from behind will not do them much damage. They must thus be fought directly, standing face to face.<br><br><i>"They're fools, but not completely incapable of negotiation. I've found trolls can often be reasoned with, which is nice when you're low on swallow or generally want to avoid some bruises."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942646|00000000||Scurvers usually feed underground, but sometimes, when they catch the scent of a human, they crawl to the surface in a matter of seconds and attack their potential prey.<br><br>While fighting them one cannot afford to forget about their special boney spines, razor-sharp protuberances sticking out from their skeletons. When a scurver is near death, the gasses and enzymes gathered within its body cause it to explode, flinging these spines out at great speed, turning them into one last deadly weapon in their arsenal.<br><br>To protect oneself against damage from these spines, one should make extensive use of the Quen sign.
2116942647|00000000||Evidence suggests cyclopses can live for an incredibly long time. The one well-preserved specimen whom scholars have examined and documented – a body found in 1112 and taken to Oxenfurt specialists – was over three hundred years old at the time of its death. The remains of this specimen could until recently be seen in the Academy's zoological museum, but they were removed from display after students tried to dress the cyclops in a toga, damaging it significantly in the process.<br><br>As in the case of giants, one can only guess at the strong and weak points of a cyclops. Its heft alone precludes effective use of the Aard sign, while its enormous physical strength would make its blows particularly deadly. Cyclopses have powerful blood streams, which not only means brown oil can be used to bleed them out quickly, but also means poison spreads through their systems rapidly. While a normal cast of the Axii sign has little effect on them, the more complex 'puppet' ability stops a cyclops dead in its tracks, even in the middle of its charge attack. It can then be made to ignore the witcher, which leaves it open to a single powerful rending attack.
2116942648|00000000||It is hard to provide a detailed description of the Ice Giant, for no witcher has ever faced it. It is known only from tales and second-hand reports that mix fact with legend. Skelligers claim its skin is blue because it was born of snow and ice, which is, of course, clearly impossible – though it does indeed seem capable of withstanding the fiercest frosts and in fact seems to draw strength from them. It can bind other creatures to its will, sirens in particular. It treats its victims cruelly and is particularly fond of human flesh. It uses simple weapons made from items looted from the bodies of those it has slaughtered.
2116942649|00000000||Luckily ice trolls live atop high mountain ridges so inaccessible they rarely encounter humans, and some suppose this is why they have not mastered the basics of Common Speech. Others claim their harsh mountain home has stripped them of an ability they once possessed, for in a land of never-ending cold there is no room for mercy or understanding. <br><br>Ice trolls are crueler than their rocky kin. Though they use similar tactics in battle – tossing stones and swinging with their mighty fists – they are heartier and stronger than rock trolls and thus more dangerous. Like rock trolls, their backs are covered in thick protective armor, meaning one should never strike them from the rear. Meanwhile their mass means that the Aard sign cannot move them. Lastly, never think of attacking them during a blizzard. At such times they draw power from the surrounding cold and fight with increased strength.
2116942650|00000000||Nekkers and phoocas live in the dark woods that grow in damp, mist-filled valleys, in colonies of one to several dozen individuals. They dig deep burrows for lairs and connect them with a network of narrow tunnels. Using these passageways they are able to move at great speed within and around their colonies. <br><br>Unlike most ogroids, nekkers are quite frail and easily cut with light, lacerating swings of a sword coated in brown oil or the shrapnel of a moon dust bomb. Be careful of the larger nekkers, sometimes referred to as 'warriors', as they boast sharper claws. <br><br>Nekkers always attack in groups and by surprise. They try to surround their prey as quickly as possible, cutting off all escape routes. Luckily their attack is, for the most part, disorganized, for nekkers are not gifted with great courage and individual nekkers will often hesitate before overcoming their fear and striking. When fighting them one can use this moment of hesitation to kill the braver individuals before finishing off those who remain in the back. <br><br><i>When surrounded by a group of nekkers, fast whirling attacks are a great way to keep the little buggers at bay while dishing out good damage."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher

2116942652|00000000||Legends often mistake chorts for sylvans, ascribing to them the ability to speak, stand on two legs, gobble up cabbage, play pranks and work mischief around the household. The arrival of a true chort in a region soon puts an end to such tales. The creatures do not speak, at best communicating with each other through grunts, snorts and moans. They get about on four legs and as for their "mischief"... they destroy farmsteads, devouring anything that can be devoured, including cabbage, if such is available, but also extending to poultry, pork, the family dog and then the family itself. <br><br>Chorts fight with little finesse, running straight towards their opponent and trying to knock him to the ground with the force of their charge. After downing their foe they bite, kick and strike with their claw-tipped paws. Due to their size and four-legged posture, they are mostly unperturbed by the force of the Aard sign, and the regenerative powers of their body allow any wounds they receive to heal at a rapid pace; this should be interrupted by inflicting bleed or poison. Like fiends, however, they are covered in fur and a contract on a chort is short work for a witcher skilled in the sign of Igni.
2116942653|00000000||Their size alone makes fiends and bumbakvetches extremely dangerous – one blow from their powerful paws can kill a horse along with its fully-armored rider. Their enormous heft also makes them invulnerable to Aard: even witchers specializing in the power of signs could not move one even an inch. Furthermore, any wounds they receive heal at lightning speed. Thus, when fighting a fiend, the witcher should debilitate the beast with poison or intense bleeding before pausing his attack to catch his breath.<br><br>If that weren't trouble enough, fiends need not rely on their strength and stamina alone when fighting. They can also call on a more refined weapon: the third eye located in the center of their forehead, which they use to draw their prey into a state of hypnosis. During these times their victim does not see anything beyond this single burning eye – the last thing they see before their death. <br><br>A fiend's weakness lies in its fear of loud noises – bombs such as Samum are thus quite effective when fighting this monster, as is fighting these creatures in thunderstorms. Furthermore, for a witcher who has no use for their hides, the Igni sign can be used to set flame to the fur that covers their bodies.
2116942654|00000000||<i>”We never hunt in these woods. Never. Even if it means the whole village starves.” </i><br>– Mulliver, ealdorman of Hoshberg in lower Aedirn<br><br>Leshi dwell in dense, primeval woods. Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory – and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Leshi old enough to earn the appellation "ancient" wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.<br>
2116942655|00000000||In some areas of the world these creatures form the center of local cults. Peasants living near their woods make offerings to them, usually of hares and birds, though human blood is not unheard of. This fact has given rise to many legends about helpful leshi chasing game towards hunters, helping lost travelers find their way in the forest or saving them from bandits. Sadly, these tales do not have an ounce of truth in them. Leshi see men only as sources of energy on which to feed. They will drain the life force of those who live nearby until only limpid husks remain. <br><br>Some leshi create magic totems that increase their strength – in such cases these totems should be destroyed before or while fighting them. Furthermore, some leshi can create for themselves a kind of immortality in the following way: the leshen wounds a lost traveler passing through its woods with its claws and casts a black magic curse on him. For as long as the individual marked in this way stays near its territory, the leshen will be reborn every time it dies. Such leshi can only be defeated by driving away or killing the person they have marked. <br><br>In combat leshi use not only their long claws but also their many allies: wolves, who unfailingly answer their call, or ravens, which harass and distract the leshen's opponent. Leshi are also able to bend plant life to their will and make it aid them in battle. It is a witcher's good fortune that leshi do have one weakness - they are extremely vulnerable to fire, and the Igni sign proves most useful in fights against them. <br><br><i>"The real danger when fighting a leshen are the damn ravens. They'll pick away at you while you're trying to kick away the wolves or dodge the vines being shot at you. Quen can save your life in such situations." </i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher

2116942657|00000000||Noonwraiths are only known to haunt rural areas, and usually stay near the place of their deaths. They prey on peasants working in the fields or children playing nearby. <br><br> Noonwraiths do not bleed and are for the most part immune to the effects of witcher signs. They can create mirror images of themselves which circle their victims in a kind of morbid parody of a dance. This ghastly ritual drains their victims' life energy while adding to their own strength. Noonwraiths are also able to manipulate the physical world to a limited degree, kicking up clouds of dust which temporarily blind and disorient their opponents. <br><br>Noonwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force a noonwraith to take corporeal form, one must first trap it with the Yrden sign or strike it with a Moon Dust bomb. Once the monster has regained physical presence, one can mount a fast attack with a silver blade, preferably one coated in veil oil. <br><br>Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are significantly weaker then than during the day.
2116942658|00000000||Like noonwraiths, nightwraiths are only found in rural areas. Travelers fall victim to them most often, but if legends are to be believed they also sneak into huts at times and murder peasants in their sleep. <br><br>When they attack, nightwraiths remain immaterial for most of the time, meaning physical blows pass right through them. They only take on more tangible form for the brief moments in which they strike. When weakened, they will create several projections of themselves which cannot attack directly but act as transmitters of sorts through which the nightwraith can sap her victim's vital energy. <br><br>Nightwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force one to take on corporeal form, trap it with the Yrden sign or hit it with the blast of a Moon Dust bomb. <br><br>Do not believe the old wives' tales and think yourself completely safe from nightwraiths during the day. They appear under the light of the sun as well - but are significantly weaker then than after dusk. 
2116942659|00000000||Wraiths are usually encountered at night, near cemeteries, catacombs and other such burial places, or else near the places that were important to them in life: abandoned homes, crumbling castles or forgotten bridges. <br><br>Wraiths suffer endless, indescribable pain. Filled with anger and a sense of having been wronged, they both envy the living and brim with overwhelming hatred for them. Like other specters, they grow in power at night and are immaterial, meaning they are not harmed by the elements or weapons designed to induce bleeding. <br><br>Wraiths can turn intangible and are at such times very difficult to wound. One can, however, force them to reassume a physical presence by hitting them with slivers from a Moon Dust bomb. As with any such ghostly being, wraiths will regain their essence if left alone too long, especially at night. Veil oil will disrupt their regeneration temporarily, which becomes invaluable when facing more than a couple of wraiths. When fighting such groups, a witcher should also protect himself with the sign of Quen, preferably one enhanced with a jolt and discharge ability. <br><br><i>"When fighting a group of three or more wraiths, you'll want the fight to end as soon as possible. Fight aggressively, focusing on one wraith at a time, otherwise it'll just retreat and regenerate while you're busy fighting the other wraiths of the group.

Chain fast attacks in a whirling motion to quickly slay a wraith."</i><br>- Words of wisdom, from an Old Witcher
2116942660|00000000||Barghests, like wolves, are stronger in packs. Together they surround their prey, leaping at it and tearing it apart with their teeth. If their prey defends itself too determinedly, they strike it with a blast of phantom fire. Since they are fast and agile, they can easily evade attacks directed at them. Barghests have some ethereal connection to the moon, and grow considerably in power on nights when it's full.<br><br>Being a type of specter, barghests grow stronger at night and have few weaknesses. The only weakness is to hurt their spectral essence directly through the signs of Quen and Yrden. A witcher unskilled in the casting of signs has to resort to skillful use of the blade and dodges...
2116942661|00000000||Beann'shies are wraiths which use their piercing cries to wake the dead to fight their foes. Their cries can additionally stun enemies, making them easy targets for direct attacks. <br><br>Beann'shies can regenerate, but this does not mean they cannot be defeated – they are vulnerable to silver and veil oil as well as the witcher signs of Quen and Yrden. <br><br>When fighting a beann'shie, there is no point using bombs or bolts, for they will do the wraith no damage.
2116942662|00000000||<br>Ekimmaras are unusually cruel and exceptionally swift. They are able to quickly land blow after blow capable of smashing even the best Mahakaman-made armor into tiny shards. Yrden should be used to slow their attacks, which gives the witcher more time to react. They should be fought with a silver sword, preferring a strong fighting style and remembering that they can regenerate back health over time. One should thus never attempt to tire them out or, gods forbid, wait for them to bleed to death. Instead, cut them down as quickly as possible and, if possible, burn the body to ash and scatter it to the four winds.<br><br>It should also be noted that many of the legends surrounding vampires are wrong, and, though the sun's rays do seem to tire them out, they do not turn to ash in the daylight. However, one should not rule out the time of day when planning a fight with a vampire, as their kind grows considerably more ferocious at night, with a full moon especially.
2116942663|00000000||When fighting a katakan one must pay particular attention to its shadow – often the only way to know its location. <br><br>Katakans are invulnerable to steel, regenerate quickly, hear acutely and move at incredible speed. To even the odds one can temporarily immobilize katakans using the Yrden sign, then seize that moment to attack with all one's might – for the katakan, like all vampires, has a tough, leathery skin. <br><br>Unfortunately, the legends are wrong and the sun's rays do not turn katakans to ash and are in fact immune to fire. They are vulnerable to sunlight, however, and when the sun stands at its zenith and the clouds are parted their regeneration is stopped and they lose some fighting spirit.
2116942664|00000000||Bruxae dart about with uncanny speed, and with their power of invisibility they can easily confuse opponents and attack unexpectedly or from behind. Thus, when fighting these vampires, the moon dust bomb is a great asset – while it cannot eliminate the vampire’s invisibility altogether, it can make it easier to track its motions. <br><br>Bruxae have incredible claws that cut through the toughest breastplate as if it were nothing, a witcher should thus prefer lighter armor that offers mobility instead of protection. Bruxae can easily break through an opponent’s guard by buffeting him with a hail of blows from all directions; these strikes are relatively light however, and can somewhat effectively be deflected with Quen. They will try to bite their prey and drink its blood once it is weakened, so every witcher who expects to encounter such a monster should swallow a black blood potion beforehand. Bruxae are also known for their sonic attacks, which knockdown and stun their prey.<br><br>While sunlight does not outright kill a bruxa, or any vampire, it does leave them more vulnerable and weakened.
2116942665|00000000||In combat alps display supernatural speed and incredible (even by vampire standards) stamina. One must aim one’s sword with great precision, for alps are unequaled in the art of evading blows. The Yrden sign is recommended, for it weakens an alp’s defenses. Another strategy is to drink the Black Blood potion, for alps suck the blood of their victims to deprive them of strength and regenerate their own powers. As with bruxae, Quen can be used to deflect an alp's rapid blows. <br><br>Unlike bruxae, alps cannot turn invisible, yet like bruxae, they emit a shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate. Their greatest asset is their agility and they can leap with uncanny lightness that appears to border on the power of flight. When in human form, they easily blend in with the surrounding community, which makes them very dangerous indeed.
2116942666|00000000||When fighting fleders it is best to take advantage of their lack of intelligence, muddling their mind with the Axii sign. These creatures do not run, but they do try to catch their prey and knock it over by lunging at them. Knowing this behavior, one can plan the fight appropriately and not let oneself be caught by surprise. <br><br>When evading the fleder's attacks, prefer long rolls over quick dashes as the creature's attacks reach far. The fleder has a sturdy hide that normal swords struggle to puncture; prepare accordingly.
2116942667|00000000||Garkains belong to the group of creatures known as lesser vampires, and are considered to be the most dangerous of their class. They often gather around themselves members of other subspecies of lesser vampires, acting in such situations as leaders of the pack. They are by and large unable to run, but can jump a great distance and often attack their prey in that way. During combat, they usually keep their distance from their foes, trying to incapacitate them using a blast of mental energy provoking visions that beguile and disorient. <br><br>Before grappling with a garkain, note again how their swings rival that of a fiend and should be avoided at all costs; the black blood potion is thus not recommended against this vampire. It should also be remembered that the samum and moon dust bombs are always effective weapons against any mental attacks, but Axii is disrupted by the mental energies. What the garkain gains in the field of offense, it lacks in defense; strike true and hard, and keep the encounter short.

The mandible had been torn off. Seeing this, Sergeant Dovate vomited profusely and the administration of smelling salts was required. The investigation has been discontinued and the deed attributed to a supernatural being.</i> <br>– fragment of a Toussaint Ducal Guard report<br><br>Fleders are classified as lesser vampires. Though weaker than the rest of their ilk in every aspect from the physiomagic to the physiognomic, they should not be underestimated – for they are very, very dangerous. Fleders cannot be mistaken for any other creature - with their wide, toothy jaws, flat, unpleasant faces and completely hairless, often warty bodies. These vampires mainly fight with their teeth and claws, flailing them blindly and not stopping even when their victim is already dead. Even a solitary fleder is strong enough to take down a trained soldier.<br><br>Fleders are sturdier creatures than other lesser vampires, their resilience often compared to golems. However they have weaker swings than their kin and display less intelligence, seen most clearly in the mindless rage which causes them to try with all their might to attack and tear to shreds any weaker being.<br>

These are noonwraiths – the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible.<br>

They are most often found in places which in the past saw pogroms, bloody rituals or cruel murders. Four types of archespore have been catalogued to date, differing from one another in terms of coloring: brown (the least dangerous), green and purple (the most dangerous). The final variant, said to have been cultivated by ages from Ban Ard, is the yellow archespore, whose strength is similar to that of its green-colored-cousins.

2116942888|41793dfd||Sphera Mundi is divided into four Elemental Planes: the Plane of Earth, the Plane of Water, the Plane of Air and the Plane of Fire. Earth and Water together form our Planet, around which circulates Air. Above Air stretches the Aether - Fiery Air, or in short, Fire. Past Fire lie the Subtle Sidereal Heavens known collectively as Firmamentum, which are of a spherical nature. That is where the Erratica Sydera, drifting stars, and Fixa Sydera, fixed stars, reside.<br><br>The Elemental Planes are inhabited by creatures which can be summoned by use of ethereal magic. They are: gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and ondynates, all of which belong to the category commonly known as elementa ("elementum" in the singular).

2116942890|b0341886||According to legend, Gabriella Maurienn, the founder of the Maurienn dynasty, was lover to Scarab, son of Godamba Thaess'en, progenitor of the Thyssenid dynasty. For this reason the Maurienns are considered kin to the royal dynasty, though no documents survive that confirm this blood tie with absolute certainty.<br><br>During its stormy history the Maurienn dynasty did not make very frequent use of its family ties to the court, though there were times when it did closely cooperate with it. Thus for example Franz Maurienn, grandson of Gabriella, was advisor to Guido Thyssen and his wife Klaudia of the Starhembergs. The chronicles tell us that while Franz dabbled mainly in healing and ethereal magic, he also conducted experiments in necromancy. Guido Thyssen, who was fond of Franz's pleasant company and sense of humor, turned a blind eye to this. His detractors claim Franz repaid his patron several times over - as a result of the magic teas Franz would send on behalf of Guido to King Gerard Troydenid, Guido was settled in the Eastern March and given the title of margrave.

Gather them by looting the bodies of monsters you slay.<br><br>Mutagens can be used in the diamond-shaped slots in the Character screen to enhance your character. They can also be used to prepare special mutagen decoctions.<br><br>Mutagen decoctions have more powerful and long-lasting effects than potions, however only one of them can be active at a time.

2119067045|6d1ad3c8||Red, green, and blue mutagens have no special abilities and are used as alchemy ingredients. Monster mutagens offer unique enhancements.
2119067046|6d1ad3ca||Look for boats along the coast and near harbors.
2119067047|6d1ad3cb||Trust your instincts if they say to avoid a fight. Large monsters, armored humans, and supernatural enemies like werewolves can prove very troublesome.
2119067048|6d1ad3cc||Dodging, rolling, parrying, and countering offer a diversity of defensive options for all opponents, but don't forget you can also run away.
2119067049|6d1ad3e3||Offense and defense are just words. You win a fight when your opponent can no longer defeat you, no matter how you get there.
2119067050|6d1ad3e6||Vitality regenerates very slowly over time. Eat food and speed up time with meditation to recover from wounds.

2119067052|6d1ad426||A torch can help lighten the gloom of the world's murky places. Witchers can also dilate their pupils at will using Night Sight.

2119067055|6d1ad446||The Cat potion increases your speed while evading harm as though you were dressed in light armor. The Tiara potion decreases enemy's ability to break your guard as though you were wearing heavy armor.
2119067056|6d1ad447||Witchers' reflexes are so sharp that a sword is enough defense to swat arrows out of the air as they fly. Upgrade this skill to gain the ability to reflect arrows back to your enemies.
2119067057|6d1ad449||If you have sustained a leg or arm injury, you may find yourself staggering or unable to counter. Clear your injuries away by healing up to full Vitality.
2119067058|6d1ad45f||There is no need to square off with a shield-bearing enemy who can block your attacks. Use long and medium attack modifiers to swing around behind him where he can't defend himself.

2119067067|00000000||Place unique monster mutagens in the appropriate slots to gain a bonus to your character statistics.
2119067068|00000000||Monster mutagens have <font color="#CD7D03">randomized</font> stats with a specific attribute.<br><br>Hunting multiple monsters of the same type can lead to the discovery of stronger mutagens.
2119067069|00000000||Evolving mutagens is not always beneficial at first, as random ones might have better stats than ones created through alchemy.
2119067070|00000000||These evolved mutagens can also be used to brew powerful potions called mutagen decoctions.
2119067071|00000000||Once you have found a <font color="#CD7D03">monster mutagen</font> you can equip it to enhance your stats, evolve it using alchemy or create a special potion called a mutagen decoction.<br><br>Open the Character panel to learn more.
2119067072|00000000||Mutagen decoctions are more powerful than normal potions.<br><br>Their effects last a very long time and they have low toxicity, but they are rare and only one can be active at a time.
