   1059760|00000000||The full list of Margarita Laux-Antille's outstanding mental, spiritual and physical attributes would consume a mountain of parchment. Rita, as her friends called her, once held the position of rector at the Aretuza Academy for Sorceresses on the Isle of Thanedd - the same school attended by her famous ancestor, Ilona Laux-Antille.<br><br>Quite unusually for one of her profession, Margarita showed no interest in politics - it was only care for the good of her school that led her to join the Lodge of Sorceresses.<br><br>Finally, her beauty deserves mention as well. It was said that not even the marble likenesses of goddesses and nymphs chiseled out by the greatest sculptors could rival this sorceress' figure.<br>
   1059773|00000000||Yet with all her astuteness Laux-Antille still could not escape the same fate that so many of her fellows met. She had been arrested some time before our tale begins and was staying in the Oxenfurt prison, awaiting a summary and pre-determined trial.<br>
   1059774|00000000||Only Geralt and Yennefer's daring jailbreak saved Margarita from certain execution.<br>

   1078471|00000000||Villard, you old bastard!<br><br>I ken where you can drub up the coin to pay off your many debts - Velen. Now, blatherheads say those bogs ain't worth a muffled fart from a saggy sow, but don't ye believe them, mate, they dinnae ken shite from sugar! A man can make a killing there - and a dwarf can do twice as good, I'm sure.<br><br>So here's the craik. While crossing Velen a week or so past, I spied a few well-dressed stiffs laying about the forest, travel bags untouched. Refugees, see, fleeing the war - and whoever flies up to them first gets all their worldly belongings. You ken what I'm saying, mate? Grab a chest, head off cross the Pontar posthaste and strip those stiffs of rings, necklaces and everything else afore some nimbler prick does! Oh, but keep a sharp axe round your belt all the while, for Velen's pure heevin with monsters. But hey, it's all in the name of a good cause - filling your pockets!<br><br>Your ever-loving Gruggen<br>
   1078472|00000000||Men are willing to do a great many things for coin - lie, cheat and even loot corpses. Villard and Gruggen were no exceptions in this regard. Like many before them, they died, probably torn to pieces by some necrophage prowling the battlefield. Chalk it up as an occupational hazard, I suppose. Luckily Geralt has good insurance against such hazards - namely the swords he carries on his back.
   1086993|00000000||Geralt never claimed to be an expert in epistolography, but experience had taught him one of its secrets: dead men carry interesting letters. That's why he decided to sit down and study closely a certain corpse-borne missive he happened across during his travels.

   1062219|00000000||Geralt did not meet Anna Strenger, the Bloody Baron's wife, when he visited Crow's Perch. Some time before his arrival this woman had disappeared in unexplained circumstances along with her daughter, Tamara.<br><br>Geralt did, however, receive a detailed description of the missing woman. Anna was a comely forty-something woman with green eyes and hair dark as raven wings which she kept tied in a tight bun behind her head.<br>
   1062220|00000000||Geralt discovered that Anna's marital life had not been working out as well as she might have hoped. She had recently been pregnant, but lost her child for unknown reasons shortly before her disappearance.<br>
   1062221|00000000||When Geralt pushed the baron about the matter, the ugly truth finally came out. Desperate and miserable, Anna had fled, taking Tamara with her, after her drunken husband beat her badly.<br><br>The baron was convinced Anna had miscarried because of his actions, but Geralt was not so certain about this - he couldn't stop thinking about the strange talisman meant to ward off evil power Anna had received from the pellar.<br>
   1062222|00000000||During their heart-to-heart the baron gave Geralt a somewhat clearer image of the Strengers' married life. While her husband was off leading military campaigns, Anna would seek comfort in the arms of a childhood friend.<br><br>Once the baron discovered the truth, he fell into an indescribable fury and killed Anna's lover, something which, predictably enough, further deepened the chasm separating the couple.<br>
   1062235|00000000||During his search for Anna Geralt discovered, to his great astonishment, that she and the gray-haired old woman in the swamp were one and the same person. The marks on her hands seemed to be symbols of some mysterious pact she had made with the Crones.<br>
   1062236|00000000||The situation grew even more entangled when Geralt discovered that, after fleeing Crow's Perch, Anna had been taken captive by some gigantic beast who carried her off into the darkness. As If that weren't horror enough, eyewitness testimony claimed her hands had burned with strange, glowing symbols shortly before this.<br><br>Perhaps this was precisely what the talisman Anna had received from the pellar had been meant to guard against?<br>
   1062245|00000000||Tamara only deepened Geralt's sad understanding of her mother's situation. The women had decided to flee together because they had had enough of the baron's drunken rages and beatings. Anna hated her husband so much that she was ready to do anything in order to be free of the man - and the child he had put inside her.<br>
   1062246|00000000||Geralt put the facts together and realized the old woman in the swamps was, in fact, Anna, the baron's missing wife. He also learned that the signs on her hands were symbols of the pact she had made with the Crones in order to get rid of her unwanted child.<br>
   1062249|00000000||Anna was found in the end, but the events she had witnessed and took part in had left such a deep mark on her body and mind that she would never again be the same. Her mind had quite simply cracked under the weight of it all, dropping her into an abyss of horror and despair.<br>
   1062250|00000000||Though Anna was found in the end, she was no longer herself, for a terrible curse had transformed her into a monster. The witcher had a good idea who had prepared this fate for her.<br>
   1062251|00000000||Geralt's suspicions were confirmed shortly thereafter. The curse afflicting the unfortunate woman was indeed the Crones' doing. Anna had turned to the ghastly sisters because she did not wish to give birth to the baron's child.<br><br>The Crones granted her wish in their own, twisted way: with a curse which made the fetus inside her wither on the vine, taking Anna's life energy with it. In despair she turned to the pellar, who made her a talisman to hamper the evil magic's influence. Anna had lost this during her fight with the baron and was thus rendered defenseless against the Crones' magic.<br><br>After that, the worst was free to happen - the markings on her palms began to burn and a fiend dragged her to the heart of Crookback Bog, where she paid back her debt as the Crones' slave.<br>
   1062252|00000000||Geralt snapped the evil spell afflicting Anna, restoring her true form. Yet the Crones had a included one last nasty pinch of vengeance in their vile brew that caused Anna to die as soon as she regained her freedom.<br><br>Anna's loved ones had time only for a brief farewell before she parted.<br>

Yet the Crones had a included one last nasty pinch of vengeance in their vile brew that caused Anna to die as soon as she regained her freedom.<br><br>Tamara and the baron had time only for a brief farewell before she parted.<br>
   1062356|00000000||Despite the witcher's best efforts, he did not succeed in lifting Anna's curse. To the despair and horror of all who witnessed it, Anna Strenger died a horrible death, incinerated by the Crones' last act of vengeance.

   1077606|00000000||<i>Folk say water hags are drowners' wives. If that be true, 'tain't no wonder why they're such ornery bitches.</i><br>– Shemhel of Dregsdon<br><br>Some tales mention water hags and swamp bints masquerading as lost old women to lure travelers back to the rickety shacks they build in the wetlands. In truth, only a blind man, or a sighted man blinded with drink, could mistake the rank sludge and rotting carrion of a water hag's den for a cozy cottage, and the hideous hag herself for an innocent grandmother. Their wrinkled, wart-covered bodies stand nearly two yards tall, colored a pinkish-green and stinking of muck and fish. Bony growths two spans long stick out from their backs, with hair like a tangle of seaweed and claws that would make a werewolf proud completing the picture.<br>
   1077607|00000000||Like drowners, with whom they often share hunting grounds, water hags and swamp bints dwell near shallow streams, rivers and wetlands. Though bulky, they are excellent swimmers. They can even swim through thick mud with astonishing agility, surfacing beside their victims to attack them with their sickle-shaped claws. They are also able to form this mud into balls, which they toss to temporarily blind opponents.<br><br>Water hags are particularly active and dangerous during rainstorms, conditions which furthermore hinder the use of the Igni Sign, usually the most effective weapon against all moisture-loving creatures.

   1054248|00000000||While in the passageways underneath Novigrad (I've been there as well, and don't recommend them as tourist destinations - if the stench doesn't get you, the monsters will) Geralt met a scholar who was excavating in search of traces of long-lost cultures. The professor asked Geralt for help removing the lid from a certain ancient sarcophagus.<br>
   1054251|00000000||Geralt decided to promote the advancement of knowledge and help the scholar open the sarcophagus. Instead of the expected withered skeleton, inside lay a fully fleshy vampire. He was not hostile at first and merely asked for a bit of peace and quiet while he finished his rest. The scholar, however, had no intention of respecting this wish. Geralt could not stop him and... the vampire lost his temper and attacked Geralt and the bothersome professor. Whether he wanted to or not, Geralt now had to end its life.

   1049076|00000000||Life, like art, abounds in tragedy, and sadly the ending of Keira Metz's story added to its cornucopia of woe. With the notes on the plague she took from Mouse Tower in hand, she presented herself to King Radovid. She was counting on obtaining a royal amnesty in return for the possibility the plague could be turned into a weapon to wield against Radovid's enemies. But she forgot one important detail - never deal with a devil, and especially not a devil backed by armies and with a fierce hatred of sorceresses. <br><br>Radovid laughed in her face, arrested Keira and had her impaled on a pike. She died in hideous agony, screaming curses against Radovid and his kingdom that echoed through the streets of Novigrad. <br><br>When Geralt returned to town, Triss asked him to help retrieve her body and give it a proper burial.<br>
   1049077|00000000||Geralt did as Triss asked, and after a bit of trouble with some guardsmen he was granted permission to retrieve Keira's body.

   1077597|00000000||<i>If night ever catches you in the swamps, stay put and wait for dawn, even if it means standing waist-deep in water with leeches crawling down your trousers. Most important of all, if you see a light in the fog, never, and I mean never, go towards it.</i><br>– Johannes Strudd, guide<br><br>Fog is the traveler's foe. In the forest, it can make one lose one's way , at sea, it can send one sailing into the rocks. Yet such dangers are nothing compared to the monsters known as foglets which sometimes lurk within it. These creatures have powerful arms and claws like Zerrikanian kinjals, yet what makes them truly dangerous is their mastery of deception, beguilement and disorientation. Many times they need not attack at all, instead simply driving their prey to madness or into boggy marshlands, after which they wait patiently for it to drown in the muddy waters.
   1077596|00000000||Foglets may appear wherever thick fog can arise: swamplands, mountain passes or the shores of rivers and lakes.  If no fog is forthcoming, they create or summon it themselves. Quickly thickening air undisturbed by the wind infallibly signals a foglet is present - and preparing an attack. <br><br>Thick clouds of mist not only allow foglets to remain unseen, but also serve as their weapons. By manipulating fog they can separate travelers from each other, hide trails and deafen noise. Like ghastly glowworms, their bodies emit a pale light they use to lure those lost in the fog towards the ravines, swamps or caves in which they make their lairs. <br><br>Even if a traveler spies his pursuer and manages to attack, the foglet can disappear into thin air before the blade hits its target. Some foglets are additionally said to possess an ability to create complicated illusions rivaling that of human mages. Whether that is true or merely one of the dark legends men tell about these mysterious monsters remains uncertain.<br><br>When fighting foglets, a witcher must remain calm and keep his wits about him no matter what. Since foglets can take on immaterial form, a slight shimmer of air or a rustle in the grass might be the only clues a witcher has to their location. Casting the Aard Sign at these beings will cause them to become tangible, giving purchase to blades and other weapons.

   1060713|00000000||While in Skellige Geralt finally had the chance to meet Cerys an Craite, the younger of Crach's two children. Known as Sparrowhawk to her friends, she was as fierce and swift as this name would indicate.<br><br>Cerys was an islander through and through and the spitting image of her father, having inherited all his courage, resolve and stubbornness. Dauntlessly she sought to prove at every turn that there was no task she could not fulfill as well as - or better than - any man in the islands, including her older brother Hjalmar.<br>
   1060714|00000000||Though Cerys' decision to stake a claim to Skellige's throne came as a shock to everyone else, she had thought it over quite thoroughly beforehand. Striving as always to outdo her brother, she intended to perform a great deed that would earn her widespread recognition and respect.<br><br>That is why she had sailed to Spikeroog to free Jarl Udalryk from the strange affliction that seemed to curse him.<br>
   1060715|00000000||Cerys did what she set out to do - with the witcher's help she freed clan Brokvar's leader from the wraith that had tormented him for years.<br>
   1060716|00000000||Cerys accepted her defeat in her race for the crown against her brother Hjalmar with dignity. She also made it clear beyond all doubt that the new leader of Skellige had her full support.<br>
   1060717|00000000||Once again Sparrowhawk gave proof of her cunning, this time by unmasking Birna's plot and cleansing the shame from her clan's name after the infamous "bloody banquet" at Kaer Trolde.<br>
   1060718|00000000||All these feats convinced the Skelligers that Cerys was fit to be queen. Though it was clear it would take some time before the young ruler could step entirely out of her father and brother's shadow, the greater part of the islanders were pleased and proud with their choice of ruler.<br>

   1053176|00000000||On a small beach on the shores of Undvik Geralt came across a man chained to the rocks, the tide threatening to engulf him. The man begged for mercy, swearing he had been framed for murder and unjustly punished.<br>
   1053190|00000000||In the village near the site of the man's punishment a group was preparing to bury the person the chained man had supposedly killed. Geralt's attention was drawn by a sobbing girl. He talked to her and learned the child blamed herself for her brother's death. When pressed for the reason why, she explained that her false accusations had caused her brother to fly into a rage and kill her uncle. In Skellige, there was only one punishment for killing a family member in cold blood: a slow death by the sea's embrace...<br>
   1053177|00000000||Geralt was convinced by the accused man's testimony and freed him from his chains.
   1053178|00000000||Geralt did not believe the chained man's testimony and left him chained to the rocks, to meet his end at the mercy of the waves and the beasts of the sea.

   1077907|00000000||<i>Out at sea, if you hear a beautiful woman singing, turn the ship around at once. You understand? Even if it means sailing straight back into a storm.</i><br>– Arike of Hindarsfjall, advice given to his son before his first solo voyage <br><br>Like skilled hunters setting out wooden ducks to lure in drakes, sirens and lamias lure men near - using their own bodies as decoys. They can transform to resemble beautiful human maidens, though with tails covered in silver scales instead of legs. Once a naive sailor gets within arm's reach of these beautiful creatures, their fair faces suddenly turn to fang-filled, fish-like maws, and lovely tails promising unknown delights become sharp, death dealing talons.<br>
   1077908|00000000||One legend claims sirens and lamias were once friendly towards men – and supposedly were even known (albeit on rare occasions) to accept some sailors' clumsy attempts at courtship. In our day, however, they are decidedly aggressive, perhaps soured by the numerous kidnappings of carried out by frustrated sea salts. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain: these days the monsters display no signs of good will, and so when spotting them one should immediately reach for one's silver sword. <br><br>Sirens and lamias (the sirens' more dangerous cousins) usually hunt in flocks, making use of their numbers as well as their ability to move effortlessly through water and air.<br><br>On the ground, however, they are virtually defenseless, and so a wise tactic is to damage their fin-like wings to force them to land. The Igni Sign also proves effective when fighting against them. Threatened or injured sirens will let out a terrifying shriek, leaving their opponents stunned while they escape – and their sisters swoop down for an easy attack.

   1048608|00000000||One thing about Geralt - he loves to meander. Instead of sitting in an inn near a warm stove, he is always putzing around fields and woods looking for gods-know-what. During one such stroll through the charming environs of Velen, he happened across tracks left by some kind of monster. Though he had no contract to kill any such beast, his witcher heart started racing at once...<br>
   1048609|00000000||It turned out a cockatrice had left the tracks. As this beast's name implies, it looks something like a rooster crossed with a basilisk and, according to Geralt, tastes a bit like chicken.<br>

   1077925|00000000||Their size alone makes fiends and bumbakvetches extremely dangerous – one blow from their powerful paws can kill a horse along with its fully-armored mount. Their enormous heft also makes them invulnerable to Aard: even witchers specializing in the power of Signs could not move one even an inch. Furthermore, any wounds they receive heal at lightning speed.<br><br>If that weren't trouble enough, fiends need not rely on their strength and stamina alone when fighting. They can also call on a more refined weapon: the third eye located in the center of their forehead, which they use to draw their prey into a state of hypnosis. During these times their victim does not see anything beyond this single burning eye – the last thing they see before their death. <br><br>A fiend's only weakness is its fear of loud noises – bombs such as Samum or Devil's Puffball are thus quite effective when fighting this monster. Furthermore, a blade covered in relict oil can increase a witcher's chances of victory – or at least of walking away from the fight.

   1055708|00000000||It started with an indecent proposal. Sasha, one of the participants in the tournament, made Geralt a proposition so brazen even his jaded jaw dropped: together they were to steal the coin set aside as the tournament's prize.<br>

   1083255|00000000||On the Isle of Mists, where the elven mage had concealed her, Geralt found Ciri at last. They could not celebrate their reunion, for the Wild Hunt descended on them. They fled, Ciri teleporting them both to Kaer Morhen, where their friends awaited.

   1049718|00000000||Keira Metz had helped Geralt in his search for Ciri, so the witcher decided to return the favor. The sorceress sought a magic lamp which the mysterious elven mage had promised to give her. Since the object was nowhere in sight, our heroes drew the only possible conclusion: that it lay concealed somewhere in the underground passageways.<br>
   1049719|00000000||Their intuition proved sound. In the end Keira found the lamp she had sought, and our heroes could return to the surface. Their trek underground had made friends of them, so Keira asked Geralt to come by her hut, as she could use some companionship in her lonely backwoods exile.

   1051806|00000000||Though Ermion was incensed (no druidic pun intended) at Yennefer and Geralt's theft and desecration of an ancient artifact, he was willing to put his anger aside to help them find Ciri. He told them of the Hunt's recent destruction of the village of Lofoten. Geralt and Yennefer knew at once it could not have been a chance attack. Ciri. They went there looking for her.
   1051818|00000000||Geralt and Yennefer's suspicions were soon confirmed. Ciri had indeed been seen in Lofoten right before the Wild Hunt appeared. Yet none who had survived the village's devastation knew what she had been doing there or where she had gone. They all agreed that the only one who might know more about her fate was a man now known only as Craven. This individual had behaved disgracefully during the Hunt's attack, for which crime he had been stripped of his name and expelled from the community. He had  then set out to redeem himself by defeating the monster dwelling in Freya's garden... and never returned.

Pirates were currently engaged in looting anything of value that had survived and Geralt decided he should try to inform someone with a right to the goods before they finished the job.<br>
   1051224|00000000||Geralt found a merchant who knew the captain of the wrecked ship. He promised he would round up some men and retrieve the cargo, hoping to salvage at least a portion of the lost goods for the rightful owner's family.

   1053025|00000000||Near Crippled Kate's, Geralt encountered a sobbing woman. He never had been able to walk unmoved past a troubled maiden and so inquired if he could be of any help. She asked if he could go inside Crippled Kate's and toss out the band of drunken Skelligers which had taken over the establishment.<br>
   1053028|00000000||Like always, Geralt successfully saved the damsel in distress. He got rid of the band of drunks and received a small purse and a grateful smile as his reward. The latter was what he prized the most.

   1058832|00000000||As is often the case with charmers, diviners, healers and other such cunning folk of the countryside, the pellar of Blackbough was a man of mystery, around whom circled a great many rumors and legends. Some claimed he could commune with the dead, others, that he had a different sort of familiarity with the grave, having put an axe in his father's head in a fit of rage when he was a young man. Still others said he showed an indecent fondness for barnyard animals.<br><br>All of these rumors aroused the fear and respect of the backwater peasants of Velen, and the pellar most likely did little to discourage them.<br>
   1058833|00000000||Yet even the most cunning of men make the occasional professional error - had Geralt not intervened, who knows what might have become of the old seer at the hands of the Baron's enraged men.<br>
   1058835|00000000||The pellar turned out to be more skilled at soothsaying than curing indigestion. Though what he divined for Geralt was murky at best, the witcher managed to put the pieces together into a somewhat logical whole.<br>
   1058836|00000000||Sometime after that the old pellar asked Geralt to help him hold Forefathers' Eve. When witch hunters sought to break up the ritual, Geralt defended its participants and earned the soothsayer's trust and respect.<br>
   1058837|00000000||Sometime after that the old pellar asked Geralt to help him hold Forefathers' Eve. Yet when witch hunters arrived and broke up the ritual, Geralt did nothing to stop them, greatly upsetting the soothsayer.<br>
   1058838|00000000||Many people have proverbial skeletons in their closet that they would be aghast to have exposed to the public eye. One can thus imagine the pellar's horror when his darkest secret literally emerged from the grave during Forefathers' Eve in the form of his murdered father's ghost. To the unfortunate shaman's further horror, old man Ambros was clearly out for revenge.<br>
   1058839|00000000||Yet Geralt intervened and the pellar was saved from otherworldly vengeance. The circumstances of the murder were explained, and the pellar, though still guilty of murder, was revealed to be a victim in his own right. By helping the pellar do battle with the demons of his past, Geralt earned himself the old man's undying gratitude.<br>

   1051197|00000000||Geralt has a "live and let live" policy regarding the gods and their worshipers:  if they don't bother him, he returns the favor. Sadly, not everyone follows this sage precept. A distraught woman in Velen informed him someone had been destroying the shrines that dot that region's roadsides. She begged him to repair the damage and, if possible, punish those responsible. Though he did not share the woman's devotion or outrage at this sacrilege, he decided to help all the same.<br>
   1051198|00000000||While following the trail of damaged holy sites Geralt encountered a group of young men who, he learned, were students at Oxenfurt Academy. Influenced by some radical philosopher, they had taken up arms in the battle against religion. As is often the case with students, what began as a measured discussion of worldviews ended in a brawl.

One can slip and fall into a ravine, be buried in an avalanche – or stumble across ice trolls. Unlike the rock trolls found at lower altitudes, these permafrost-dwelling monsters treat every man they encounter as a possible ingredient for a tasty meal.<br>
   1077869|00000000||Luckily ice trolls live atop high mountain ridges so inaccessible they rarely encounter humans, and some suppose this is why they have not mastered the basics of Common Speech. Others claim their harsh mountain home has stripped them of an ability they once possessed, for in a land of never-ending cold there is no room for mercy or understanding.<br><br>Ice trolls are crueler than their rocky kin. Though they use similar tactics in battle – tossing stones and swinging with their mighty fists – they are heartier and stronger than rock trolls and thus more dangerous. Like rock trolls, their backs are covered in thick protective armor, meaning one should never strike them from the rear. Meanwhile their mass means that the Aard Sign cannot move them. Lastly, never think of attacking them during a blizzard. At such times they draw power from the surrounding cold and fight with increased strength.

   1051856|00000000||It is a truth universally acknowledged that children only prove more troublesome as they mature. In Crach's case, any troubles his offspring had caused him only doubled after King Bran's death, when both his son and daughter joined the ranks of the claimants of Skellige's throne.<br>Tradition demanded the next king be a great hero, and Hjalmar, Crach's son, felt he fit the bill perfectly. As anyone versed in fable knows, there is no more fitting way to prove oneself a hero than to kill a giant - and it so happened there was one such beast in desperate need of slaughtering on the nearby isle of Undvik. Thus Hjalmar had organized an expedition and set off to earn his glory. Unfortunately, there'd been no word of him since and the jarl had begun to worry. Like many before and after him, he took this worry to the witcher.
   1051857|00000000||Helping Hjalmar an Craite did not prove easy. Undvik had gone feral after the ice giant drove its inhabitants away, with monsters running amok on the island as though it were some mad mage's experiment or a misguided entrepreneur's attempt at an innovative hunting preserve. Yet in the end the witcher triumphed, not only finding Crach's son, but also helping him kill the giant and avenge the men the beast had murdered. His heroic deed accomplished, Hjalmar could now leap out of the starting blocks in the race for the Skellige crown.
   1060561|00000000||Geralt searched every inch of Undvik until he finally came across Hjalmar near the giant's lair. Hjalmar had journeyed there to free Vigi, one of the members of his crew. As he deemed the cause a worthy one, Geralt decided to lend Hjalmar his sword.<br>
   1060560|00000000||Geralt set out to find Hjalmar an Craite, but first came across the lad's companion in arms, a man by the name of Folan. Folan told the witcher that Hjalmar's crew had scattered when the giant attacked. As for the fate of Hjalmar himself - that Folan could not tell him.<br>
   1087108|00000000||Geralt agreed to help Hjalmar, true, but as I consider the matter now, with the benefit of hindsight, I can't help but think he only did so to spare old Crach's feelings. For - if I may speak frankly, Dear Reader - the witcher went about finishing the job like a man whose intentions were firm but his flesh... lacking. In brief, he saw to other, more important matters, hoping Hjalmar would  handle the giant on his own. Perhaps he counted on that an Craite blood showing its virile power once more...

   1051970|00000000||Geralt discovered the haunted house hid secrets not within its walls, but underneath its foundations. A powerful earth elemental, also known as a d'ao, had been imprisoned in its basement.

   1050623|00000000||When a witcher investigates, he expects to uncover the unexpected. He will learn, for example, that it was not a monster but the owner's brother who waylaid a missing caravan, or that the werewolf thought responsible for a streak of bloody murders would in truth never harm a fly.<br><br>Yet no investigation in witcher history had brought as many surprises as the search for Ciri. At one point Geralt discovered the key to finding her was a repulsive, brainless creature he called Uma. The witcher could sense this ugly being was no child of Mother Nature - even she could never be so cruel - but the result of sorcery. In other words, its deformed flesh was but a sort of magical cage in which someone else was trapped. The question was - who?<br><br>Geralt decided to take Uma to Kaer Morhen, so that he and his fellow witchers could confer about how to lift its curse.<br>
   1050624|00000000||It turned out to be Avallac'h - a powerful elven Sage whom Geralt had encountered during his previous adventures. Breaking his curse proved extraordinarily difficult and, though the treatments succeeded, they had deposited the elf on the brink of death.<br><br>Luckily, he still had a sound mind in his tattered body and was able to pass on the message they had waited so long to hear - Ciri was alive. Avallac'h had hidden her from the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists, a place tucked outside of time and space.<br><br>Yet even there she was not truly safe and, sooner or later, the wraiths would find her. It was clear to everyone that fleeing and hiding once more would only delay the inevitable. Geralt thus decided to fetch Ciri from the Isle of Mists and, with her and his friends at his side, give fight to her pursuers.
   1051290|00000000||Geralt knew Uma currently resided at Crow's Perch. The baron's bandits, hungry for a bit of unrefined entertainment, had made Uma their jester. Geralt knew he would have to put an end to this farce, take the unfortunate being from Velen and, with Yennefer's help, try to lift the curse that held him.<br>
   1051291|00000000||Before this could happen, however, Geralt once again had the honor to face the emperor of Nilfgaard. Emhyr had run out of patience and demanded that Geralt report back on any progress he had made in his search for Ciri. Geralt presented Uma to the emperor and explained the unsightly fellow's role in the investigation. The emperor had hoped Geralt would return with someone other than a demented monstrosity, but ultimately recognized the creature as a solid lead in the search for his daughter Cirilla and handed over a portion of the reward he had promised the witcher. Geralt never revealed exactly how much that amounted to - he never did place much value on coin - but I wager, dear reader, it considerably exceeded the standard fees witchers received.<br><br>During the audience Yennefer hit upon an idea for lifting Uma's curse - though, not for the first time, she refused to share any details with Geralt. She merely told him to ride as fast as possible for Kaer Morhen, the famous keep of the witchers from the School of the Wolf - the home Geralt had not seen for some time, save in his dreams.

   1086966|00000000||The vengeful wraith known as the White Lady had roamed the fields for a long time, murdering anyone she cam across. Though the sheaves hung heavy from grain, the frightened peasants were kept from harvesting them and thus faced famine. They gathered their last bit of savings and went in together on a bounty for a witcher. That was coin well-spent.
   1087328|00000000||<i>Micko and his band? Who're they?<br>Four lads, drunkards and good-for-nothin's, all. They'd drained a few pints and decided they'd all plough the White Lady, maybe then she'd bugger off.</i><br>– Conversation overheard in a field outside Novigrad<br>
   1081909|00000000||The apparition haunting the fields outside Novigrad turned out to be a noonwraith. Some powerful emotion must have bound it to that place - love, hate, anger or perhaps all three at once. Like every wraith of this type, she was surely capable of forming mirror images of herself, which serve to mislead opponents and restore her vitality. Luckily, these mirages could be dispelled with a quick slash from a silver blade. Like any noonwraith, she would undoubtedly seek to assume immaterial form while fighting, making her almost impossible to injure - unless she is first caught in a trap laid by the Yrden Sign, or blasted with a special bomb. Once thus forced into materiality, she should be attacked with strong blows or the Igni Sign. Finally, one must always keep in mind two witcher sayings: "The longer you fight a noonwraith, the lower your chances of surviving," and "Fight a noonwraith at midday and you'll be dead before dusk."

Fuckers' tails're more like cleavers.</i><br>– Yavinn Buck, veteran of the Mahakaman Volunteer Regiment<br><br>Forktails owe their quaint name to the long, sharp growths at the tip of their tails. A blow from this weapon can slice an oaken shield in two – along with the hand that was carrying it. Thus though its name conjures images of cutlery, fighting a forktail is nothing like a dinner party and ends in death rather than dessert.<br>
   1077784|00000000||Forktails are active by day. They usually hunt alone or, more rarely, in pairs. They attack big game, including domesticated animals, mainly cattle and pigs, and even humans from time to time.<br><br>Like all draconids their massive size does not stop them from flying and attacking from the air. They use their weight and height advantage as they swoop down to knock their prey over with their wings. Once on the ground, they are somewhat less mobile but still dangerous, turning to other tactics centered on attacking with their massive, spike-covered tails.

   1062440|00000000||In times of war one often encounters people who have suffered cruelly at the hands of fate. Geralt was thus not shocked when he encountered the woman called Gran by the children in the Velen swamps, even though she seemed to have seen manifold unspecified ills.<br><br>Whatever her woes, it was clear she cared for the war orphans in her charge with love and devotion.<br>
   1062444|00000000||Gran bore strange marks on her hands that burned with living fire. It turned out they were signs of her indentured servitude to the Crones. How exactly the old woman had come to be in their power, however, remained unknown.<br>
   1062445|00000000||When Geralt heard from the fisherman about burning marks on Anna’s hands, he quickly added one and one to draw a conclusion. Though recent events had changed her nearly beyond all recognition, the Gran he had met in the swamps must have been the Bloody Baron’s wife.<br>
   1062446|00000000||When Geralt saw the marks on the woman’s hands, he quickly realized she must be the Bloody Baron’s wife, though changed beyond all recognition by the hardship she had suffered.
   1086543|00000000||Geralt’s first attempts to talk to her came to nothing. He was only able to break through her mistrust with the help of the godling named Johnny. A few words from him convinced Gran to help Geralt talk to the mysterious Ladies of the Wood.<br>

    363506|00000000||<i>Vedymins, known also as witchers - a mysterious and elite caste of warriors </i>cum<i> priests. According to folk beliefs, they possessed magical powers and superhuman abilities, which they then used to fight evil spirits, monsters and other malevolent powers.</i><br>--Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, vol. XV <br><br> I know witchers just a bit less thoroughly then poetry and the fair sex -- meaning, I know them very well. During one of my many adventures, I befriended not just the famed Geralt of Rivia, but also his teacher, Vesemir, as well as his confreres, Lambert and Eskel. But enough about me. <br><br> In a nutshell, witchers are monster slayers for hire. They fight beasts with a silver-plated sword and simple spells known as Signs. The witchers' excellence in swordfighting is the result of years of excruciating training and magically induced mutations which greatly enhance their senses and reflexes. Unfortunately, these mutations, achieved through a rite called the Trial of the Grasses, are extremely dangerous and more often than not end in a long and painful death.<br><br> As a result of many provocations and slanderous gossip, witchers became first feared and then hated, leading in turn to persecution and pogroms which very nearly put an end to their caste. Yet some of them survived and ply their peculiar trade to this day, traveling back and forth across the Northern Realms, killing monsters for a small fee.
   1066550|00000000||<i>If I hear anyone say Temeria ceased to exist, I'll smack 'im on the face. With brass-knuckles.</i><br>--Vernon Roche, former head of Temerian special forces. <br><br> Until very recently, Temeria was considered the most powerful of the Northern Kingdoms, which, together with its allies, was capable of standing up to the ever more aggressive Nilfgaardian Empire. However, the tragic death of king Foltest proved that Temeria was just a giant with feet of clay. Without its ruler, it was unable to withhold yet another raid from the South. Just a few months after the offensive began, silver lilies fluttering over Vizima were replaced by banners bearing the Great Sun, the symbol of the empire. <br><br> Even though most Temerians gave up hope, some never came to terms with the humiliating defeat and the erasure of their beloved country from the world's map. Hiding in the dense forests of Angren and mountainous Mahakam, they wait impatiently for an occasion to take up arms and fight the odious oppressor.
   1068409|00000000||<i>Redania is the oldest of the dh'oine kingdoms. I remember its beginnings very clearly. All those broken oaths, rapes and murders... </i><br>--Ida Emean, elven Sage <br><br>I find it hard to write about Redania objectively, as it is there that I, Dandelion, came into this world -- a truly momentous event, noted by all respected historians (who, for some inscrutable reason, insist of adding me a few years).<br><br>But back to Redania. The kingdom is currently ruled by Radovid the Fifth, very rightly nicknamed "The Stern", an irreconcilable enemy of all mages and sorcerers. Its emblem -- a white eagle painted on a red field, its capital -- Tretogor, built upon the ruins of an elven city. Among the other urban centers one should definitely name Oxenfurt, home to the world-famous Academy, and the port of Blaviken, where Geralt gained the nickname "Butcher" after killing (in a rather cruel fashion, I must add) the renegade princess Renfri and her brigands.<br><br>Recently, Redania has greatly increased its territory by deceitfully taking over the lands of its neighbor and erstwhile ally, Kaedwen. Radovid, who was expected to defend all Northern Kingdoms from the Nilfgaardian invasion, turned out to be a ruthless aggressor himself.
   1068418|00000000||<i>There's no up-to-date map of Nilfgaard. 'Cause it just keeps on growing. </i><br>-Amerigo Veltucci, cartographer<br><br>Right until about a quarter century ago, only the well-educated even heard about Nilfgaard. Back then the empire, though already expanding, did not yet cast its shadow over the Northern Realms. Today, when the black-clad soldiers carried banners with the Great Sun across the Yaruga River all the way to the southern banks of the Pontar, there's no man in the North who doesn't know the empire's name -- and does not shiver upon hearing it.<br><br>Nilfgaard is currently ruled by Emhyr var Emreis, a great politician and strategist. The country consists of about half a dozen of provinces, formed on the basis of once-conquered lands, and many satellite countries, such as Ebbing, Salm, Toussaint, Maecht, Metinna or Cintra which, though formally independent, are in fact governed by the emperor.<br><br>For such a diverse and quickly expanding state, Nilfgaard is surprisingly stable. No rebellion, uprising or domestic war has ever upset the famed <i>pax nilfgaardiana</i>. This might be due to the fact that Nilfgaardians cherish order above all other, including wars and conquest -- and  respect laws and courts to an extent unparalleled anywhere in the North.
   1068419|00000000||<i>You might be rich back home in Redania, mate, but here in Kovir you'd be a shoeshine at most... If you'd pay the one thousand marks entry fee at the Shoeshine Guild, that is.</i><br>--Joulke van Henning, townswoman from Lan Exeter. <br><br>Kovir and Poviss were once a dirt-poor, backward province of Redania. Rocky shores, barren fields and god-awful weather deterred all but the most desperate outcasts and exiles from settling there. But the picture had changed dramatically once all but inexhaustible natural riches were discovered under the snow-covered peaks of the Dragon Mountains. Since then, in less than two centuries, Kovir and Poviss not only managed to secure independence, but became the richest of the Northern Kingdoms.<br><br>Today, the kingdom's power rests on a healthy economy and commerce, and its sovereignty is secured by both extensive trade agreements and legions of very well paid mercenaries. Kovir and Poviss are also reputed to be the most tolerant and enlightened of the Northern Realms, meaning that persecuted mages and non-humans often flee there, seeking refuge.
   1068420|00000000||<i>Do you know what the Eternal Fire is? Unextinguished flame, symbol of survival, path through the darkness, promise of progress and a better tomorrow? Eternal Fire is hope itself.</i><br>--Chappelle, head of the Eternal Fire Temple Guard. <br><br>The cult of Eternal Fire was established a few centuries ago in the Free City of Novigrad. Its main symbol is the undying flame, which symbolizes hope. As the years passed, the cult grew more and more popular, eventually becoming the dominant religion.<br><br>Initially tolerant of other faiths, the cult of the Eternal Fire grew increasingly more radical with time. As the fire which was supposed to repel darkness started lighting the pyres, the flame which was once the symbol of hope became the sign of terror and oppression. Anyone can become the enemy of the Eternal Fire. Mage, alchemist, elf, dwarf... And witcher, too.
   1068421|00000000||<i>Anyone in possession of information pertaining to the whereabouts of members of the despicable Lodge of Sorceresses, or rather Wicked Witches and Kingslayers, is obliged, under the pain of death penalty, to report immediately to our gracious ruler.</i><br>--Decree signed by Radovid the Stern <br><br> The Lodge was founded by a group of sorceresses from the Northern Realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard. Its aim was to guard and determine the future of the art of magic. Initially, this secret organization had a salutary influence -- for example, few know that it is thanks to these sorceresses that the Treaty of Cintra, which ended the Second War with Nilfgaard, was signed.<br><br>Unfortunately, initial successes convinced members of the Lodge of Sorceresses of their infallibility -- and affirmed the already strong conviction that a noble goal justifies all means. Instead of advising, mentoring and criticizing the world's rulers, sorceresses started working behind the scenes, pulling the strings and getting involved in morally dubious plots. As a result, the sorceresses were implicated in the so called "Assassinations of Kings", the chief victims of which were kings Demavend of Aedirn and Foltest of Temeria.<br><br>As it later turned out, the sorceresses were only pawns in the hands of emperor Emhyr var Emreis, who thus, in one masterful stroke, discredited Lodge's venerable members and got rid of the most important rulers of the Northern Realms.
   1068440|00000000||<i>ATGAB? The hell that's s'pposed to mean?</i><br>–Hans Schmetterling, Temple Guard corporal, on a ubiquitous Novigradian graffiti<br><br>The Temple Guard used to be Novigrad's secret service – one with a pretty awful reputation. It was credited with persecutions of the Hierarch's political opponents, forging documents, assassinations, kidnappings, blackmail, racketeering as well as good ol' robberies. When this particular story took place, their main task was to assist witch hunters in tracking down and killing the unfortunate mages who flocked to Novigrad hoping to avoid Radovid's persecutions.
   1068441|00000000||<i>Over the Pontar and through the woods, to Ban Glean we go, through the white and drifted snow!</i><br>--Folk song<br><br>Taking its source in the Blue Mountains, flowing from the East towards the West, Pontar used to be an important commercial waterway as well as a natural border between the kingdoms of Redania and Kaedwen on one side and Temeria and Aedirn on the other. Today, it is the last major strategic obstacle blocking the progress of the invading Nilfgaardian army.
   1068442|00000000||<i>I'll never take a human for an apprentice. Not that I'm a racist -- I just know that the very day they learn to hammer steel as well as we do, they'll get rid of us. Just as they did with the Vrans and werebbubbs. </i><br>--Latke Vicario, dwarven smith from the Vizima Outskirts <br><br>History of the dwarfs reaches back to the times from before the Conjunction of the Spheres. They are characterized by a meager height and stocky build, great diligence and an even greater love of gold. Humans think them honorable and reliable -- and, at the same time, boorish and rude. They are also known for their somewhat irrational fear for the safety of their less then attractive females, which, they deeply believe, all other races plot to kidnap for gods know what wicked purposes.<br><br>Dwarfs, pragmatic as ever, assimilated rather painlessly into the human society, adopting many habits of the dominating race. Still, they are often distrusted and mistreated -- and every once in a while some of them perish in pogroms directed against non-humans.<br><br>However, some more conservative dwarfs, especially those sympathizing with the Scoia'tael, refused to accept the human rule and hold their meeker kinsmen in deep contempt.
   1068443|00000000||<i>Jurgen keeps telling everyone how he lost his eye at the Battle of Sodden. Truth is, it burst after a certain angry halfling flung a stone at him in revenge for trampling his carefully trimmed flower bed.</i><br>--Anna Hilger, washerwoman from Carreras <br><br>Great historians have precious little to say about the beginnings of this humble people. What is clear, however, is that they came into existence long before humans. Contrary to elves and dwarves, halflings offered no resistance to the Big People, as they call us, and chose to live peacefully under the human rule. This attitude earned them an unfair reputation of duffers and cowards and overshadowed their many virtues, such as resourcefulness and diligence.<br><br>Halflings are natural-born farmers and stock breeders, so it comes as little surprise that most of them live and work in the countryside. Those who do reside in human cities try their luck in commerce or run small workshops, breweries and inns. <br><br>Halflings' peaceful nature did not protect them from Big People's enmity and persecutions. However, when hard-pressed, jovial halflings prove to be able warriors, fighting furiously to protect their belongings and, above all, families -- those who put their kin in danger, no matter how big or powerful, should expect armed resistance. <br><br>During the previous war, there were many stories about deserters and bandits disappearing without a trace upon entering peaceful halfling villages. Most think these tales plucked out of the air. However, having seen halflings shoot arrows and fling stones with terrifying force and precision, I wouldn't be so sure.
   1068444|00000000||<i>O, Freya! Give me strength to love, to bear children, to give birth to warriors, to kill enemies!</i><br>--A prayer for Skellige girls<br><br>Among the many gods of the Skellige Isles, it is beyond doubt Freyja, the goddess of the hearth, love and fertility, who is regarded most highly and revered most fervently. Many think her identical with Melitele, worshiped on the continent -- but one should not mention this hypothesis to the islanders, for they think it a blasphemy and a grave insult.<br><br>Freya is also the protector of prophetesses, seers and telepaths, as illustrated by her attributes: Brisingamen, gem which allows seeing into the future, cat, which hears and sees what is hidden, and hawk, which watches from the above. Freya's main temple is located on the island of Hindar. It's surrounded by a holy grove, from where the sacred mistletoe, a key ingredient of each and every Skellige ritual, is harvested.
   1068445|00000000||<i>Your Excellency, I am writing to you with the humble request to annul my excommunication. Since you have, absolutely justly, cursed me, no one ever comes to my shop anymore, people dump the vilest of excrements on me from the windows, and whenever I enter an inn, they spit into my drink and food alike...</i><br>–a letter from Janne Gregorius, draper, to sister Nenneke<br><br>Cult of Melitele is derived from the primitive, primeval human beliefs revolving around fertility, love, farming, domestic hearth and pregnant women, personified in the form of various feminine figures. With time, all these minor deities become one – All-mother, or Melitele. <br><br>Unlike other old religions, which either fizzled out completely or became insignificant, limited to a few forgotten altars and isolated temples, the cult of Melitele holds strong. The goddess is revered by all women, irrespective of birth and station, and so no lord would consider hurting her priestesses, unless he wanted to upset the whole womanfolk – as well as his own wife.<br><br>The most important center of the cult of Melitele is undoubtedly Ellander, known across the whole world for its cloister, where future herbalists, doctors and midwives train under the watchful eye of sister Nenneke.
   1068449|00000000||<i>Kid got into my way, so I smacked'im right across the face. Brat started cryin', so I 'it 'im again, hopin' he'd shut up. And then... Windows shattered, glass went flyin' and my coat went afire, jus' like that.</i><br>--witness's statement, inquiry regarding the so-called "Bloody Tuesday"<br><br>A "source" is a person endowed with a wild, unbridled magical talent -- in other words, an involuntary medium, through which sheer Power can flow. These talents usually remain dormant and undetected for a long time. When they finally manifest themselves, however, they tend to do so with a bang, for when the source draws its power for the first time -- or rather, when Power breaks out of the source -- results are almost always highly destructive. <br><br>Should a source be identified early on, however, it is possible to teach him or her to control the Power within their bodies. Such individuals usually move on to become powerful sorcerers.
   1068448|00000000||<i>Unexpected child? Aye, have one of those each year... Unless you mean somethin' else?</i><br>--Elke Vrijdek, townswoman from Ban Glean<br><br>An Unexpected Child is bound by the laws of destiny with the person to whom it had been promised, usually in return for a favor. One who wanted to invoke the Law of Surprise, upon hearing he will receive whatever he may wish in exchange for his assistance, uttered the following words: "you shall give me what you find back home that you did not expect." What is meant here is of course not a lover hiding under the wife's bed or mother-in-law who dropped by with an unannounced visit, but the child born or taken in during the absence of the person swearing the oath.<br><br>They say that children thus marked by the Fate grow up to do great things. The famous hero Zatret Voruta and Supree, who freed the Mad Deï from his curse, were Unexpected Children. One other such child was of course Ciri, Geralt's apprentice and adopted daughter.

It's something about grammar, right?</i><br>--Overheard during a resit exam, Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Questions regarding the Conjunction of the Spheres inspire terror among Oxenfurt's students. This is because this event is almost impossible to grasp for the human mind. It's devilishly hard to understand it -- and explaining it is even worse. Therefore, instead of trying yet again to put it in words, I'm copying the answer from my own exam, marked E minus. Those who'd like to know more should consult an academic rather than a poet. <b><br><i>Conjunction of the Spheres is a magical cataclysm, which, by our calculation of the time, took place one thousand and five hundred years ago, give or take. As a result, our world became infested with, like, an awful lot of totally dangerous beings from all sorts of different times and dimensions, which we call monsters. Conjunction of the Spheres also gave birth to magic, </i>id est<i> a supernatural power which only a select few can bridle. The times of the Conjunction of the Spheres are remembered only by the oldest of elves -- and of course dean Haarer.</i>
   1068451|00000000||<i>Amid a starless night, the Alder Folk, the Aen Elle, will come, their faces painted with hoar-frost, their eyes pale like the moon...</i><br>--Elven prophecy, author unknown<br><br>The oldest legends of the Aen Seidhe elves mention a lost tribe -- Aen Elle, Elder Speech for Alder Folk. Their paths separated many centuries ago, we are told, when the Conjunction of the Spheres gave birth two dozens, if not hundreds of different worlds. Aen Elle settled down in one of them, creating their own kingdom. <br><br>It is hard to say anything about this race with certainty. All I know is that this elven tribe was reputed to be warlike and conquered many lands, destroying those who stood in its way without mercy.
   1068452|00000000||<i>If you hear hooves beating at night, but no one rides down the road... If you can see a blood-red glow on the horizon, but the air is free of smoke... If it suddenly gets cold, even though it was warm during the day... Collect your family forthwith, bar the door, close the shutters, extinguish the hearth and hide in the basement.</i><br>--Old Pellar's Nuggets, Second Edition <br><br>The Wild Hunt is a half-legendary cavalcade of ghastly specter riders, clad in rusty armors, galloping across the night sky on skeleton steeds. It's coming is interpreted as an infallible sign of coming war, hunger and disease.<br><br>Those who spot the Wild Hunt on the night sky, freeze in terror, and those who stand in its way, die or disappear without a trace. And this isn't just tall tales -- there are many reliable accounts of people purportedly carried away by the Wild Hunt. They sometimes return, many years later, not remembering a thing about their long captivity, looking exactly the same as they did on the day they were captured -- even though the graves of their loved ones have long been overgrown by grass and weeds.
   1068453|00000000||<i>You wanna sail to Skellige, eh? Why not slit yer throat 'ere n' now and save us all the hassle?</i><br>--Overheard in the harbor of Bremervoord<br><br>The rocky, inhospitable Skellige Archipelago consists of six major islands and dozens of smaller islets. Since times long past it has been home to a fierce and warlike nation of sailors, merchants and pirates. They value freedom above all else, and indeed even the simplest Skellige fishermen possess almost the same rights as their clan leaders, known as jarls. The latter, in turn, answer only to the king they elect from amongst themselves.<br><br>For a long time, Skellige was closely allied with Cintra. After Cintra fell to Nilfgaard, however, the islanders swore revenge on the empire and have since been its most irreconcilable and vicious enemy.
   1068454|00000000||<i>All dh'oine are savages... But the ones from Kaedwen are the worst. As if someone dressed hogs in jerkins on taught them to walk on hind legs.</i><br>--Toruviel, free elf from Dol Blathanna<br><br>To the east of Redania lies the youngest of the Northern Realms -- the vast and densely wooded Kaedwen. Its capital is Ard Carraigh, but the kingdom's true pearl is beyond all doubt the city of Ban Ard -- which fits this somewhat unrefined realm like a square peg in a round hole. <br><br>Kaedwen has always been a troublesome neighbor. For example, under the rule of king Henselt Kaedweni forces marched into Aedirn, formally an ally, taking advantage of the fact that its armies were preoccupied fighting the invading Nilfgaardians. Such traitorous deeds earned the Kaedweni a reputation of bandits and bastards -- whereas in fact they are generally a forthcoming and hospitable people. They are known for their coarse sense of humor and  famous sayings, such as "a whore won't score 'gainst ano'er whore", which indisputably contain some folk wisdom.<br><br>There's one other proverb which the fate of Kaedwen proved true -- "at length is the fox brought to the furrier." After years of harassing its neighbors, it was Kaedwen's turn to suffer. When Nilfgaardian armies invaded for the third time, king Radovid V The Stern of Redania did not rush to its aid, but instead defeated the overstretched Kaedweni forces in what can only be called a blitzkrieg and incorporated its lands into his own realm. And so today Ard Carraigh and all the important forts along the Pontar river are manned by soldiers flying the Redanian banner.
   1068508|00000000||<i>If we'll continue bickering among ourselves, Redania and Temeria will end up like Cintra. Black from the ashes and Nilfgaardian banners.</i><br>--Alexandre de Tocqueville, Temeria's ambassador in Redania, shortly before the fall of Vizima<br><br>The Kingdom of Cintra, lying on the southern banks of the Yaruga river, was in the way of Nilfgaard's expansion -- and so it was the first of the Northern Realms to fall to its might. When conquered, it was not incorporated into the empire -- instead, it remains a formally independent kingdom, ruled by a puppet monarch. <br><br>The fall of Cintra became a symbol of Nilfgaardian cruelty -- and the battle of the Marnadal Pass, in which the Cintran forces were eventually defeated in spite of outstanding bravery, is considered the beginning of the so-called Northern Wars. The sack of Cintra's capital has been dubbed the Slaughter of Cintra -- and rightly so, for not even children were spared by Emhyr's soldiers. The heroic deaths of the city's defenders, and in particular queen Calanthe's, the Lioness of Cintra, have been lauded in many songs and tales. And so until very recently the rallying cry of the Northern Realms' armies was "Remember Cintra!"
   1068509|00000000||<i>Ain't a stall without at least a Mahakaman awl</i><br>--Temerian saying<br><br>Dwarves have lived under the Mahakam mountain range, lying between Temeria and Aedirn and Lyria since time immemorial. They are known all around the world for their excellent workshops, smithies and foundries, which produce highest quality steel -- and weapons. <br><br>Mahakam dwarves are technically subordinate to kings of Temeria, but in fact are all but independent from the human rule. They answer only to one of their own, the Elder. Today, this title is borne by one Brouver Hogg, a wizened old dwarf known for his obsession with the traditions of yore. During the wars with Nilfgaard and the following conflicts, Mahakam dwarves supplied the Northern Realms with arms and even put up their own voluntary contingent, which fought valiantly during the famous battle of Brenna.
   1068510|00000000||<i>Velen? Been there once, once only. Got lost, rode down the wrong path, me cart got stuck in the marshes. So I went to the nearby village, askin' for help... Shite, that was really dumb of me.</i><br>--Norbert Angler, traveling merchant<br><br>Even during the times of peace, when Velen hasn't been swarming with bandits and deserters yet, I used to stay well clear of this cursed place. For some unfathomable reason , I always found sparsely populated marshlands, dirt-poor villages and boorish yokels repellent. Even Zoltan, admittedly less refined than myself, always said that Velen is nothing but "barrens, bushes and chorts."<br><br>Now that Velen has been ravaged by wars, its bogs and swamps became true feasting grounds for all sorts of necrophages and other carrion eating monsters. It comes as little surprise, then, that no one, with the possible exception of job-seeking witchers, ventures there anymore.
   1068511|00000000||<i>Calm down, good sir, 'cause if you keep on sputterin' like that, you're goin' to soil yer esteemed spouse's dress. Sure, the wine's expensive. As it should be, given it came straight from the Toussain' vineyards!</i><br>--Angelique Duvin, merchant from Novigrad <br><br>Toussaint, and it's breathtaking capital, Beauclair, are beyond doubt among the most charming corners of the earth. The inhabitants of this blessed land, starting with its ruler, duchess Anna Henrietta -- a distant relative of Emhyr var Emreis's, by the way -- all the way down to the simple peasants, live their lives as if they were a never-ending ball. Each day starts and ends with wine, songs and romance, each day is marked by some sort of a holiday, feast or other festivity, one more sumptuous than the other. <br><br>The Duchy of Toussaint does not possess a regular army -- it's borders are protected by knights-errant, known for the peculiar oaths they swear by when joining the ranks of this unusual brotherhood. Add the fact that Toussaint is a world-famous wine producer and exporter, and the image you'll get is a happy, if also somewhat tipsy little statelet, ever celebrating -- and out of touch with reality.
   1068512|00000000||<i>If you're going to lie to me, Frans, at least show some imagination. Dog ate your homework? Why not a dragon, who flew here all the way from Zerrikania, desperate to find out what you had to say about the political system in Brugge?</i><br>--Marabella, teacher from Novigrad<br><br>This exotic, semi-legendary land lies far, far away to the North-East, beyond the Blue Mountains. Very little is known about it, for few people have traveled there, and even fewer managed to return. There are stories, though -- about incredible wild animals and terrifying monsters, including poisonous insects the size of an ox and of course dragons, which the Zerrikanians revere like gods. If even a few of these tales are true, then Zerrikania is a land as beautiful as it is dangerous. <br><br> Zerrikania is also known for rare spices, excellent bows and dangerous women -- warriors for hire, clad in lion furs and with tattooed faces, unmatched both on the battlefield and in the alcove. Armed with the curved <i>saberras</i>, which they use with deadly precision, Zerrikanian women earned a reputation of excellent but prohibitively expensive mercenaries.
   1068513|00000000||<i>I don't get it. Ruins like any other, really.</i><br>--Johnny from Mare Hill, Redanian army sergeant <br><br> The ancient city of Loc Muinne lies at the source of the Pontar river, right at the feet of the Blue Mountains. Its crumbling walls have been a mute witness of innumerable tragedies, a few of which I will briefly outline herein. Historians say that Loc Muinne has been built many centuries ago by the lizard-like race known as the Vrans. After their fall, the city has been taken over by the Aen Seidhe elves. Their rule over Loc Muinne has been put to an end by the infamous Redanian marshal Raupenneck of Tretogor, whose soldiers slaughtered all inhabitants of this ancient city, paying no heed to their victims' age or sex. After the massacre, the city was abandoned and has been slowly decaying ever since. <br><br>Loc Muinne has been painted red with blood yet again during the recent summit of the North's rulers and various other worthies. The many plots, provocations, murders and even an attack of a dragon have been overshadowed by other dramatic events, that is, exposing the treacherous conspiracy of the Lodge of the Sorceress, Radovid's rise to dominate the North and the political triumph of the Nilfgaardian Empire, which managed to sow the seed of discord between the rulers of the North and thus cleared the decks for the coming invasion.
   1068514|00000000||<i>This is supposed to be Alzur's Double Cross? More like Moron's Single Rhomboid. Sit down, F.</i><br>--Margarita Laux-Antille, chancellor of the Aretuza School of Sorceresses<br><br>Until very recently, the city of Aretuza, situated on a little islet of Thanedd off the coasts of Temeria, was famous for its School of Sorceresses. Becoming one of its students was considered a great honor -- and meant paying an even greater fee. The quality of the education, however, justified the expenses. The alumnae of this venerable institution were immensely respected and were sure to land great jobs immediately after graduating.<br><br>Among the School's chancellors were many famous sorceresses, including the grand mistress Tissaia de Vries and Margarita Laux-Antille. Among the famous alumnae, on the other hand, one should mention one Triss Merigold and a certain Yennefer of Vengerberg.<br><br>Unfortunately, the School has suffered greatly during the so-called Thanedd Coup, when the North's magicians jumped at each other's throats. And since it never rains, but pours, just a few years later, when mages' persecutions started, the School was closed down for good.
   1068517|00000000||<i>Soaring spires, tall as yews... Houses of white marble... And a sky upon which twin suns burned...</i><br>--Statement by Lidke var Mwahar, a Nilfgaardian reputedly captured by the Wild Hunt. Classified material.<br><br>The city of Tir na Lia was said to be the capital of the Aen Elle elves and the seat of their king, Auberon Muircetach. Few people had the opportunity to see it, with the possible exception of those who have been captured by the Wild Hunt and taken to their realm. From among those I know, only Ciri has been there for some time, but she never wanted to talk much about it. I have heard from other sources, however, that Tir na Lia is a city of great beauty, and its sight alone fills one's heart with great admiration, but also longing and unspeakable grief.
   1068518|00000000||<i>What is magic? I can show you... If you're not afraid, that is. </i><br>--Keira Metz, sorceress<br><br>There are many learned definitions of this term. I am myself partial to the uncharacteristically poetic one offered by my friend Ciri, who said that magic is Art, Chaos and Science combined. For art is indeed both artistry and curse, threat and progress. It all depends on who wields it and what purposes it is made to serve. <br><br>Magic is sometimes also called Power. Mages claim they draw it from Nature itself, or, to be more precise, from the Four Elements of which it comprises. They say it slumbers in the earth below us, in the fire which purportedly burns in its core, the air we breathe and water we drink. Drawing upon its Power its the very basis of mages' education, for mastering it allows them to achieve things beyond the wildest dreams of regular mortals.
   1068519|00000000||<i>For nigh is the Time of the Sword and Axe, the Age of the Wolven Blizzard. Nigh is the Time of the White Frost and White Light, the Time of Madness and Disdain, Tedd Deireádh - the Final Age. The world shall perish amidst ice and be reborn with the new sun.</i><br>--Ithlinne's Prophecy<br><br>Priests, scholars and sorcerers all have different definitions of the White Frost and conflicting theories as to where it is to come from. Some speak of a natural cooling of the climate, likely happen in three thousand years or so, bringing utter destruction, reducing civilization to ruin and pushing the whole of humanity back toward and age of barbarism.<br><br>Yet others think the White Frost a more esoteric and mysterious evil, one that will shatter not just our world, but many other worlds, too. Whatever the case, if there is but a grain of truth in Ithlinne's Prophecy, acquiring woolen hose, a sheepskin jacket and a fur hat may not suffice to weather the coming storm.
   1068522|00000000||<i>Holy blood, cursed blood! Blood of the murderess and blood of the saviors! Blood of the birth, blood of the death!</i><br>--Fragment of a prophecy<br><br>Hen Ichaer, the mysterious Elder Blood, can be traced back to the elven Sage Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal -- who, even though she was meant to marry another, fell in love with a human mage, one Cregennan of Lod. And even though the two lovers died horrible deaths, their line survived. There are many legends regarding Lara's offspring -- some entirely wrong, some containing a grain of truth. <br><br>According to some prophecies, the Avenger will be born of the Elder Blood, one who will drown the whole world in blood and will build a new one on its ruins. Other revelations, however, claim that Hen Ichaer will be our only protection from the White Frost. According to the famous elven seer Ithlinne, it is from Elder Blood that the mysterious Zireael will emerge -- the Swallow, bringer of spring and rebirth.
   1068523|00000000||<i>What's the difference between a Sage and a sorcerer? Same as between a campfire and a volcano, dear.</i><br>--Millegarda of Redania, lecturer at the Aretuza School of Sorceresses<br><br>The term "Sage" is a rather loose translation of the elven expression "Aen Saevherne". Humans often think it's a synonym for the word "sorcerer" -- but they are gravely mistaken. The enigmatic Aen Saevherne do of course use Power, and with great proficiency, but at the same time possess an impressive knowledge regarding not just magic, but also medicine, art and -- as I was told -- other worlds, dimensions and time itself. <br><br> Even within the elven society, Sages form a separate, mysterious but also greatly respected caste. They follow their own moral code, the basic premise of which, it seems, is the well-being of their people.
   1068524|00000000||<i>Ragh nar Roog! Ragh nar Roog! Ragh naaaar Roooooog!!!</i><br>--Skellige battle cry<br><br>Skellige legends are as beautiful as they are gloomy. Islanders love stories about bloody vendettas, battles and heroes laughing at the face of danger. One myth masterfully combines all these elements -- the legend of Ragh nar Roog, the final battle between men and gods on one side and monsters, specters and demons from the land of Morhögg on the other. The outcome of this conflict is supposed to determine whether the world will be shrouded in eternal darkness or if the sun will rise yet again. <br><br>The battle will commence with the coming of Tedd Deidrach, the Time of End, Time of White Frost and Wolf's Blizzard. First will come the ghastly Naglfar, a longship built of the deceased's fingernails, carrying a crew of evil specters. Then, Kambi the Rooster will crow, waking the mythical hero Hemdall, and he in turn will sound his horn, giving a sign of the coming battle, in which the world's fate will be determined. <br><br>Skelligers treat this legend very seriously. This is why they cut their dead's fingernails short before burying them, hoping that this will slow down the construction of Naglfar and the world's end. On a side note, it's interesting that there are many overlapping points between this legend and the prophecies regarding the coming of the Time of End and White Frost, which one can hear on the continent.
   1068526|00000000||<i>In short, megascope offers a means of communication over great distances. For example, I can use it to ask one of my esteemed colleagues for advice regarding a particularly complex spell -- or ask if the new dress makes me look fat. </i><br>--Fringilla Vigo, sorceress<br><br>Since I'm an honest and humble fellow, I readily admit that I know little about how megascopes -- that is, sophisticated communication devices use by mages -- really work. <br><br>What I do know is that, unlike the famous crystal orbs, which can be used only to communicate with one other, synced orb, megascopes have a wide array of  functions. Mages can use them not only to talk to each other, but also to spy on others, conduct magical searches, observations and gods know what else.
   1068528|00000000||<i>It pulled… pulled the stake from its chest and drove it forcefully into Florian's eye. And then… I fear you will not believe me. Unless I show you my scars…</i><br>A story about higher vampires overheard in a tavern along the high road to Scala<br><br>As Geralt once explained to me, this term is oft erroneously applied as a catch-all for a number of more powerful varieties of vampire, including bruxae, alps and katakans. Said species do indeed exhibit some singular characteristics not observed in their "lesser" cousins, whence the tendency to describe them as "higher" vampires. Yet in spite of peculiarities like their resistance to sunlight, ability to assume human form, or certain telepathic skills, they are not, in fact, higher vampires <i>per se</i>. <br><br>For higher vampires are a distinct and unusual variety of beasts. Their powers are extreme and often unique to single specimens. They also possess personalities, desires and motivations, and thus are in no way driven solely to hunt in order to satisfy their thirst for blood. They can live for years among ordinary folk without ever betraying their true nature. Incredibly quick, resistant to fire and, for the most part, to silver, they are foes even witchers need fear.
   1068529|00000000||<i>What's that? You want to pay with orens? What, did you spent last six months hidin' under a rock? Orens are worse as much as bean husks now!</i><br>--Heinrich Zucker, merchant from Ellander<br><br>The war between Nilfgaard and the Northern Realms not only resulted in changing borders, but also turned the entire continent's economy upside-down. Currencies, in particular, have been greatly affected by the recent political upheavals.<br><br>The surest coin these days is the crown minted in Novigrad. Thanks to the Free City's vibrant economy, this currency is highly valued and is the only means of payment accepted all around the world, by the North's merchants, nobles, townsfolk and simple peasants as well as Nilfgaardian quartermasters, dwarven bankers, women plying the world's oldest trade and, last but not least, witchers.<br><br>Nilfgaardian floren's value depends on the empire's economy rather than its gold content. The initial success of the empire's military campaign greatly boosted its worth, but months later, the prolonged conflict started taking its toll and the coin's worth is now dropping slowly but surely. Still, Nilfgaardian florens can be exchanged into crowns at most banks and shops. <br><br>The Temerian oren, still bearing the aquiline profile of the now-deceased king Foltest is, like Temeria itself, the greatest victim of the war. The value of the currency of this battered, occupied country holds at a stable, but very low level, reflecting the coin's silver content. Still, my good friend Vimme Vivaldi, Novigrad's foremost banker, advises getting rid of the Temerian currency at the earliest convenience, just in case.
   1077128|00000000||<i>Mole-hill this big? Interesting...</i><br>--Last words uttered by Vaclav of Ostrava, royal gardener<br><br>Before I met Geralt, the word "nest" had very pleasant connotations -- for it made me think of songbirds, such as jays or nightingales, and is a part of "love nest", an expression which brings back the best of memories.<br><br> The witcher made me realize, however, that it's not just harmless birdies who build nests -- but also dangerous monsters, such as nekkers or phoocas. Geralt said one should destroy their nests using bombs, such as Grapeshots or Dancing Stars -- a rather useless piece of advice, however, given that I haven't touched explosive materials since my first year at the Oxenfurt Academy, when, by pure accident of course, I have blown up the School of Alchemy.
   1078206|00000000||<i>Whatever your heart's desire, you're likely to find it in Novigrad. Zerrikanian spices? As many as you please. Gwyhyrs hammered out in ancient gnomish smithies? Not a problem, two for the price of one. Wine from Toussaint? All vintages you may desire at your beck and call - if you have the coin, that is. Lots of it.</i><br>--Patricia Engelkind, Novigrad townswoman<br><br>Novigrad is often referred to as the world's capital - and not without reason. Its immense wealth, influence and strategic importance make it a power unto itself, a power even the kings of the North as well as the emperor must respect. For whoever controls the Free City with its vast treasury, numerous manufactories and workshops and, last but not least, sizable fleet, holds the key to the Northern Realms. <br><br>Unfortunately, in recent times the freedom which Novigradians claim to value so highly has given way to anarchy. The Church of the Eternal Fire persecutes mages and nonhumans, while bandits, until recently constrained by the unwritten criminal code, jump at each others' throats and foreign spies scramble to gain influence over the city's councilors and priests. The air of Novigrad is now thick with smoke bellowing from the omnipresent pyres, and its cobblestones have turned slippery with blood.
   1078207|00000000||<i>Dandelion? Sure I remember him! He was banned from coming less than one hundred feet of the School of Alchemy... And less than three hundred feet of the girls' dormitory.</i><br>--Lincoln Worcester, key keeper at the Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Oxenfurt is world famous for its university, my <i>Alma Mater</i> -- Oxenfurt Academy. Having spent many years there, I think of Oxenfurt with great sentiment. Once, this city resounded with the buzz of voices, songs of tipsy students and shouting merchants, whose stalls were weighing down under innumerable exotic articles from all over the world. Professors spent their days on academic discussions, students sat through hours of lectures and drank through many pints of ale afterwards -- for alcohol, as it is widely known, greatly lubricates the difficult process of absorbing knowledge. <br><br> However, this cradle of science, art and unconstrained thinking has become the thorn in the side of the enemies of tolerance and freedom. After Radovid's rise to power, privileges of the university -- which, in theory at least, was both apolitical and exterritorial -- were successively restricted and eventually cancelled. Protesting lecturers were fired and, if they persisted, thrown in jail, and a few were even beheaded. As for the Academy itself, it has been closed down until further notice. And so despotism, pride and insanity have triumphed over culture, love of truth and wisdom -- at least for some time.

Their units, ranging in size from a handful to a few dozen fighters, consist mostly of elves and dwarves, with just a few halflings and gnomes who decided to take up arms after years of putting up with discrimination and persecution. In spite of their lofty, even noble goals, Scoia'tael are known for the unsurpassed cruelty with which they treat human soldiers and civilians alike. <br><br>The first Scoia'tael units were formed during the First War with Nilfgaard, but continued their fight even after the truce with the empire was signed. They set ambushes along on forest tracks, attacked isolated villages and lone travelers. After the Second War with Nilfgaard and the subsequent founding of Dol Blathanna, the elves' own state, many Scoia'tael laid down their arms. Yet the fiercest insurgents carried on, fighting not for freedom, but to satisfy personal vendettas. The memory of Scoia'tael cruelty remains very much alive among humans, and parents still use the names of legendary rebel commanders like Isengrim Faoiltiarna or Iorveth to scare naughty babes.
   1078311|00000000||<i>Three drops of quicksilver... Two pinches of saltpeter... A cup of aqua regia and an ounce of-- Shite! Run for your lives!</i><br>--Petrus Bonus, alchemist, known as Pete Three Fingers<br><br>Alchemy is an art of concocting various magical substances. It is particularly important for those plying the trade of a witcher, as it allows creating special potions, bombs and oils, which, when applied to the sword's blade, greatly enhance the damage dealt against specific opponents. <br><br>Alchemy requires harvesting extremely rare or even unique ingredients, extensive knowledge of secret formulas and a lot of patience. As it was often remarked by my lecturer of Alchemy at the Oxenfurt Academy, "the ancient and respected art of Alchemy unveils its mysteries only to the select few who will persist in striving for knowledge and truth, against all odds."<br><br>This might very well be true, but I quickly came to the conclusion that mastering this art, even if it lead to discovering Philosopher's Stone itself, is not worth spending hours upon hours stooping over retors, alembics and measuring cylinders. Nevertheless, I have great respect for this discipline, for it is thanks to alchemy that the process of distillation, the very basis of brewing spirits, has been discovered.
   1078312|00000000||<i>What humans are, you can see for yourself</i><br>--Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, vol. III<br><br>Since humans landed at the mouth of the Yaruga river five hundred years ago, they have brought most of the known world under their control. Conquering the lands of the Aen Seidhe elves, pushing dwarves back to their lair under the mountains of Mahakam, or near-extermination of the Vrans and werebbubbs are all a grim, but indisputable sign of our race's supremation. <br><br>Unlike the other races, humans are not particularly long-lived, but they do possess other advantages, such as high fertility or adaptive skills -- which they have used to appropriate other civilizations' elements of culture, art, science, magic, art of war, medicine and even dress.<br><br> Our chief weakness, on the other hand, is undoubtedly the utter inability to cooperate and cohabitate with others -- which puts us so starkly apart from the halflings, dwarves, gnomes and even elves. Many scholars believe that internecine wars, which have been the curse of humanity since the very beginnings of history, will also be the reason behind its eventual collapse.
   1078316|00000000||<i>We took many useful things from the elves... and gave precious little in return.</i><br>--Triss Merigold<br><br>The Aen Seidhe elves are but a shadow of their former selves. Centuries ago, they ruled almost the entire Continent, boasting a refined culture, sophisticated art and advanced science. The arrival of humans quickly put an end to this golden age - in one bloody war after another, the Aen Seidhe were defeated and decimated, their cities and gardens razed and turned to ruins. The survivors were either driven off into the wilderness of the Blue Mountains or forced to live humiliating lives in ghettos, facing never-ending chicanery and persecution. It comes as no surprise, then, that many took up arms again and joined the ranks of the Scoia'tael rebels, swearing to push humans back into the sea. <br><br>Elves are extremely long-lived - the passing years are but the blink of an eye to them. What also sets them apart from us is a very narrow window during which they can procreate, and, as a natural consequence, their very low fertility. The Aen Seidhe believe this to be the main reason for their decline. As one of my elven friends put it, "Even though we fought like wolves, we lost to a race which fucks like rabbits."

But sometimes they're right.</i><br>–Francesca Findabair, elven mage, ruler of Dol Blathanna<br><br>It may seem incredible, but I swear it's true – our world is not the only one there is. Somewhere out there, separated from us by both time and space, exist many other universes. They are home to many, mostly hostile creatures, some of which have come unto this world during the cataclysm known as the Conjunction of the Spheres.<br><br>The existence of such worlds is postulated by mages, some scholars and a few priests. Their hypotheses are corroborated by elven legends, according to which the Aen Seidhe have once possessed the ability to travel between the dimensions. They purportedly did so using magical portals placed inside the famous elven towers, the ruins of which are still to be seen in some isolated parts of the world.
   1078323|00000000||<i>Either I'm goin' crazy, or this bloody powder-box is talkin' to me!</i><br>--Klaus Bober, fisherman from Tarn Mira, finder of Rience's xenovox <br><br>Xenovox is a relatively simple magical instrument, which usually looks like a little box, casket or richly adorned snuff-box. It is used to communicate over long distances -- however, unlike the megascope, which projects an image of the speaker, xenovox carries only his or her voice. <br><br>How this contraption might work, I haven't the foggiest idea. Once, driven by curiosity, I took apart a xenovox which belonged to a good friend of mine. Contrary to popular belief, inside I did not find sirens' lips or a gnome with a speaking trumpet, but only dozens of little springs, screws and cogs gleaming with magic --which I was utterly unable to put back together.
   1078324|00000000||<i>"Valley of Flowers"... That's rich. More like a valley of traitors, murderers and ploughin' whores.</i><br>--Henselt, king of Kaedwen <br><br>These days, Dol Blathanna is the only elven state in existence. It lies at the eastern fringe of Aedirn, at the feet of the Blue Mountains. It has been created pursuant to the Cintra Treaty -- which ended the last war with Nilfgaard -- on the strength of a clause added on Emhyr var Emreis's demand. The Aen Seidhe elves have paid dearly for the emperor's support -- in order to gain it, they first had to support his armies by engaging  the Northern Realms' soldiers in bloody guerilla warfare. <br><br> When the human settlers of Dol Blathanna learned that they have to abandon their houses and return the valley to its original inhabitants, they reduced it to ashes and rubble in pure frustration and anger. Demavend, then king of Aedirn, to whom this sliver of land belonged at the time, not only did nothing to stop his subjects, but even aided them in destruction, sending over his solders dressed in civilian clothes to cut down the forests, poison the lakes and kill off the valley's wild animals. <br><br>Elves took over the ruined valley without uttering a single word of complaint. In just a few years, Francesca Findabair, the valley's ruler, and her right hand, the Sage by the name of Ida Emean, managed to return Dol Blathanna to its former glory. The valley's fields, fertilized with ashes, yielded record crops, and new palaces quickly replaced the ruins. Elves have reclaimed a bit of the world they once controlled -- but soon they might have to fight its defense, for Nordlings now hate and resent Aen Seidhe more than ever.
   1078325|00000000||<i>Ne t'aervenne comm Nordling! [Don't you behave like a Nordling!]</i><br>--Nilfgaardian expression<br><br>"Nordling" is an umbrella term for all inhabitants of the Northern Realms, used mostly by Nilfgaardians and, more rarely, the people of Skellige. It is a highly offensive name, which implies laziness, treachery, barbarity and excessive lust. I would like to say that we do not deserve such a damning reputation -- however, I generally try not to lie.
   1068431|00000000||<i>Laura? As soon as she figured the hunters are after her, she jumped outta the window. She'd rather break her neck than end up in their hands. </i><br>--Overheard in Putrid Grove<br><br>Back when religious persecutions started targeting the once-respected mages, a new profession was born -- witch hunters. These self-righteous brutes may come from different backgrounds, professions and social strata, but they have one goal which unites them all -- tracking down and killing all suspected of dabbling in magic. <br><br> Some witch hunters are religious fanatics, others -- calculating opportunists, who concluded that pursuing mages would be an easy way to enrich oneself and secure an elevated station in the "new, better order" promised by their sponsor, king Radovid.

   1077930|00000000||<i>Sylvans are cruel, greedy and treacherous. Still, I prefer them to dh'oine.</i><br>– Yaevinn, legendary Scoia'tael commander<br><br>Sylvans and yakshas, a kindred species, are extremely rare woodland creatures whose appearance combines traits of goats and rotund men. These beings usually pose little danger, for they limit their contact with humans to playing harmless (though often bothersome) tricks and eating crops from their fields.<br>
   1077931|00000000||Sylvans and yakshas resemble men not just in appearance but also in behavior – though it must be said they have adopted more of our vices and weaknesses than strengths. Lazy by nature, they would gladly spend every day in idleness, puffing on pipes, gorging on rich foods and downing strong drinks. <br><br>Since sylvans and yakshas enjoy partaking of the fruits of others' labors without asking permission, men do not take to them kindly and at times, fooled by their awkward appearance, will try to solve this problem using force. This often ends in tragedy, for sylvans, despite their corpulent frames, are astonishingly strong and agile. They also emit a powerful and extremely unpleasant scent which can cause even a witcher, whose line of work accustoms him to foul stenches, to gag and feel faint. Watch out in particular for yakshas, which are fiercer and keener on fighting than normal sylvan.

   1086956|00000000||<br>Though the Hound fought fiercely, it nevertheless fell to the witcher's blade. By killing this dangerous monster, Geralt saved the humans, halflings and, last but not least, bees of the area from further torment.
   1087327|00000000||<i>Something's destroyed our fields and hives. We think it's... the apiarian phantom.</i><br>Holofernes Meiersdorf<br>
   1081907|00000000||The "Apiarian Phantom" destroying the Meiersdorf family's hives turned out to be a lost Hound of the Wild Hunt. When fighting such a beast, one must bear in mind three things. First of all, that the thick armor of ice covering it can only be pierced by strong blows. Second, that, like any other frost-born creature, it is vulnerable to fire, the Igni Sign included. Third and last: that it shall show no mercy.

   1077673|00000000||<i>Men, the polite ones, at least, would call me a monster. A blood-drinking freak.</i><br>– Emiel Regis, higher vampire <br><br>Only a mutual thirst for blood links higher vampires to their distant and much more primitive cousins: ekimmaras, alps, katakans and the like. Higher vampires are, in fact, much more similar to humans than to those bat-like blood slurpers. They not only resemble us in appearance, but also share our intelligence and behavioral patterns. This means they do not squat in distant forests or hide in the shadows. On the contrary, they are particularly fond of cities, where they live out deceivingly normal lives. Even witchers are not capable of recognizing them at once, for their medallions remain perfectly motionless in the presence of higher vampires. Yet all these similarities should not blind us to an essential difference: unlike men, higher vampires are immortal. Those who have faced them in combat and survived can be counted on one hand.<br>
   1077674|00000000||It is a witcher's good fortune that higher vampires are extremely rare – and not all are dangerous to humans. Though they do have a taste for blood, they do not need to drink it to survive. Some higher vampires have renounced feeding on humans altogether and do no harm to anyone, but others give in to their desires. A witcher who braves fighting a higher vampire must bear in mind that he faces a monster endowed with incredible strength, one invulnerable to fire, able to manipulate men and animals, turn invisible and transform into a giant bat - and furthermore one which it is nearly impossible to kill. In other words, even an experienced monster slayer should think twice before accepting a contract on one of these creatures, even if half a kingdom and a princess' hand is in the offing.

   1048622|00000000||After a long search Geralt was at last a step from his goal. Avallac'h had hid Ciri from the Hunt on the magical Isle of Mists, which could only be reached if fate deemed one worthy - or by following a magic firefly, which was decidedly the easier option. Geralt thus readied himself to sail to the isle and bring back Ciri.<br>
   1048623|00000000||Finally. After years of separation, weeks of searching, dozens of false trails and endless worry, Geralt had found Ciri. They were not given long to celebrate their reunion, however. As soon as Ciri awoke from her magic slumber the Wild Hunt picked up her trail and began to attack. Geralt and his adopted daughter thus had no choice but to use Ciri's special abilities to flee to Kaer Morhen and face their attackers there.<br>

   1061860|00000000||I always considered it a point of particular pride to count Triss Merigold of Maribor among my closest and dearest friends. This exceptionally talented sorceress was a shining star of her profession, the former mage advisor to King Foltest, and a famous hero of the Battle of Sodden, known as the Fourteenth of the Hill. Yet in no way did she resemble her often unbearably haughty sisters in magic. Her deft mind, warm smile and considerable personal charm had always won over even the hardest of hearts.<br><br>Though my personal relations with Triss never ventured beyond the fraternal, Geralt of Rivia at one point found her allure irresistible. From then on the two shared feelings that ran far deeper than a superficial and fleeting fancy.<br>
   1061861|00000000||Yennefer told Geralt that Triss had recently taken up residence in the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061862|00000000||It seemed Triss had gone into hiding from the so-called witch hunters persecuting magic wielders in the city, turning to one of the leaders of the local underworld for protection.<br>
   1061863|00000000||After a bit of a run-around Geralt found the sorceress, who had indeed entered into an arrangement with the so-called King of Beggars. She paid for his protection by providing magic services to his organization. Though Triss did not know anything about Ciri and her stay in Novigrad, she promised to do all within her power to aid Geralt's search.<br>
   1061866|00000000||Though theoretically Triss and Geralt had ended their romance half a year earlier, it was clear the feelings they felt for each other had not vanished so easily. To deal with this, the sorceress pretended that nothing had happened and the witcher, as is his wont, sheepishly masked his feelings with a mix of hesitant interest and fake indifference. It must be said that both of them handled the situation quite awkwardly.<br>
   1061873|00000000||The plan to get close to Caleb Menge that Triss presented to the witcher was very risky and placed her in great danger. The sorceress knew, however, that Ciri's life might be on the line, and so did not hesitate for even a moment.<br>
   1061876|00000000||The sorceress' laugh, the look in her cornflower blue eyes, the memory of enchanting moments spent together - all that surely weighed on Geralt's decision to kiss Triss in the Vegelbuds' garden. And though their moment of sweet oblivion lasted briefly, it breathed a gale's worth of new life into the feelings between them.<br>
   1061877|00000000||Triss and Geralt had been through thick and thin together, but on that fateful day, on the wind-swept Novigrad docks, they bid their final farewells. She sailed off for Kovir, while he stayed and choked on the smoke wafting off the pyres of Novigrad.<br>
   1061879|00000000||Yet Geralt and Triss in fact met again, at Kaer Morhen. Triss had come on Yennefer's request to help defend Ciri, whom she had always treated as a younger sister.<br>
   1061880|00000000||Though Triss and Geralt said their final goodbyes on that wind-swept Novigrad dock, in the end the sorceress decided not to leave for Kovir after all. She knew that when Geralt asked her to stay, the witcher was opening up his heart to her for the first time.<br>
   1061883|00000000||Geralt and Triss met again at Kaer Morhen. Triss came on Yennefer's request to help defend Ciri, whom she had always treated as a younger sister.<br>
   1061884|00000000||Not for the first time Geralt showed what a babe in the wilderness he was in matters involving the fairer sex. For while I can vouch from experience that there are indeed women who will willingly share a man with their best friend, when trying that with those to whom one has declared his true and undying love, matters tend to resolve themselves in an entirely different matter.<br><br>Toying with Triss' feelings ended in humiliation for Geralt, a fate which, I must admit, he thoroughly deserved.<br>

   1077619|00000000||<i>Friend of mine used to say that with all these griffins and basilisks and whatnot, good old fashioned wolves weren't nothing to worry about… Then the damned beasts devoured half his flock.</i><br>– Yngvar, shepherd<br><br>Once upon a time wolves were the absolute rulers of the forest. Men used them to frighten children, while adults, too, trembled at the sound of their howling. Post-Conjunction monsters not only pushed wolves into the deepest wilds but also took over their place in human nightmares. Yet this does not mean the old predators ceased to be a danger. Wolves do not have a drop of magic within them, breathe no fire and spit no acid, but that in no way stops them from killing unwary travelers and hunters.<br><br>Particularly dangerous are wargs, a nasty and ferocious subspecies of wolf, and the snow-white wolves which today can only be found in the wild highlands of the Skellige archipelago.<br>
   1077620|00000000||Wolves usually feed in packs counting from a handful to over a dozen members, though some particularly strong males hunt alone. Though wolves are weaker than many post-Conjunction monsters, they make up for any lack of strength with their intelligence. When fighting them one must be especially careful not to become surrounded. The presence of wolves can also signal more serious trouble – these predators often share their hunting grounds with werewolves and leshens.

   1086968|00000000||<br>To bait the vampire, Geralt took note of its dietary preferences and seasoned his blood to match by loading up on cheap wine. This made it somewhat harder to aim his blows, true, but he still managed to defeat the beast - then had another battle awaiting him the next morning, this one against a powerful hangover.
   1087325|00000000||<i>Vampire bites... and the strong stench of alcohol.</i><br>– Geralt of Rivia<br>
   1081904|00000000||Contrary to popular belief, monsters are not all alike. Like people, individual members of the same species can each have their own unique traits, preferences and weaknesses. A good example of this is the katakan which once fed on the inhabitants of Oxenfurt. Perhaps influenced by its close proximity to the hard-drinking student youth of the city, this vampire had developed a keen appetite for blood spiked with a hefty dose of hard alcohol - and also baubles and gaudy jewelry of all kinds.<br><br>The vampire had clearly thrived on its high-octane diet. It had grown exceptionally strong and gained the ability to regenerate lost life quickly, cause heavy bleeding with its claws and, if all that were not enough, meld into the air and appear again behind its opponent's back. Luckily the Quen Sign meant the witcher was well-equipped to defend against this surprise attack, and the Yrden Sign would let him catch the monster in a trap.

Then sail to Undvik, climb the mountain and walk the ridge. Bow once to each of the four winds, commend yourself to the gods and toss the chest into the sea."<br><br>Holvarg did as the druid counseled, then returned to the Sacred Grove. "I tossed the chest in the sea," Holvarg said. "But I don't feel one bit wiser." The druid replied, "That is because there are no shortcuts on the road to wisdom. Neither saying prayers nor making offerings nor listening to the words of wise men will grant it to you. That is your lesson.” Hearing this, Holvarg flew into a rage and strangled the druid with his bare hands, then stuck his head on a pike and set it out in front of his house, so everyone would know that, while he might not be wise, he was nobody's fool.<br>

   1051076|00000000||While traversing the fields near Midcopse, Geralt came across some strange tracks. He would not be a witcher if he did not look into such a matter.<br>
   1051078|00000000||Geralt discovered that the monster the locals called Jenny o' the Woods was in fact a common nightwraith. This unfortunate being had been born of a woman murdered by her rejected lover. The story of their star-crossed fate moved me to pen a tear-jerking ballad... but the witcher was mainly moved to find a way to bait and destroy the wraith.<br>
   1054850|00000000||Geralt drove off the nightwraith that the unfortunate Zula had become. I derive some small pleasure in knowing that a person to whom life had been so cruel found at least this measure of relief after death...<br>
   1058328|00000000||While in the area around the village of Midcopse, Geralt decided to look around and see if there wasn't anyone in need of a witcher.

   1048576|00000000||Continuing his tour of rural Velen, Geralt stopped by the village of Lindenvale. There he came across a grief-stricken old woman. The cause of her woe? She was homeless, a monster having made its nest in her family manor and forced her into a rental situation elsewhere that had recently proven unaffordable. When Geralt approached her, she asked him to rid her manor of this beast. In return she gave him a precious token - the key to the chest in which she claimed to keep her life savings. Geralt couldn't refuse to help an elderly person in need, especially not one so eager to reward him handsomely for it, and so decided to do as she asked.<br>
   1048577|00000000||Geralt rid the Reardon family manor of its monstrous dangers. When Dolores heard the news she was beside herself with joy, as the place was closely tied to her fondest childhood memories - to the days when she was young and beautiful and lived there with her brother and parents.

All that was left for him to do was to tell the woman that her former home was now safe. When Dolores heard the news she was beside herself with joy, as the place was closely tied to her fondest childhood memories - to the days when she was young and beautiful and lived there with her brother and parents.<br>
   1048578|00000000||Speaking of that brother... while in the manor, Geralt happened across a most unusual find - the body of a young man bricked up behind a wall. It seemed this was no macabre bricklaying accident but a grisly murder - the man was Humbert, Dolores' brother, and his murderer Dolores' first husband, Roderick. He returned to Dolores and told her this, and, though learning the truth froze the old woman's blood in her veins and undoubtedly took years off the already short time remaining to her, she was grateful to Geralt for the information.<br>

   1001947|00000000||Concern filled Crach's voice. And something else… pride? The jarl had pulled Geralt aside during King Bran's wake to confess his worries about his daughter, Cerys. She had sailed to Spikeroog, seeking to cure Jarl Udalryk's mysterious affliction. A dangerous mission, though one that would certainly be less so with a witcher's help. Geralt eyed his old friend over carefully, then made his decision.<br>
   1001948|00000000||Geralt sailed to Spikeroog to help Cerys. Any doubts about whether this help would be needed were dispelled immediately: he found her lying unconscious in Udalryk's former home, now an abandoned ruin possessed by a mysterious force. When she regained her senses, she told Geralt her suspicions regarding Udalryk. The jarl did not commune with the gods, as many believed. Instead, a ghost tormented him, whispering destructive thoughts in his ear. A ghost -- if true, she would definitely need a witcher's aid. Geralt decided to help.<br>
   1001949|00000000||After analyzing all the evidence, Geralt came to the conclusion that Udalryk was not haunted by a ghost, as Cerys had thought, nor was he insane or touched by the gods, as many Skelligers believed. The situation was far more grave: a particularly malicious wraith, known as a hym, had latched onto the jarl. Geralt and Cerys thus faced the challenge of finding a way to free Udalryk from this evil being's power.<br>
   1001950|00000000||In the end, Geralt decided against meddling in Udalryk's personal affairs and left Cerys, whom he knew to lack neither courage nor resourcefulness, to resolve the matter herself.<br>
   1001951|00000000||Cerys hit upon an idea. They would trick the hym. Geralt decided to trust her. Cerys ran off, snatched Udalryk's infant child from its cradle and ran back towards the abandoned home, with the jarl and his honor guard hot on her heels. Meanwhile Hjort, whom Cerys had informed of her plan and asked for help, slipped into the house unnoticed.<br><br>Once inside, Cerys commanded Geralt to toss the babe into a burning stove. Caught off-guard by this seemingly-mad request, Geralt nevertheless acquiesced, hoping it was all part of the plan. To his great relief, it was. The hym, thinking Geralt an infanticide, left Udalryk to latch onto this new, even more guilt-ridden victim. Yet when it was revealed the child had survived unharmed, the evil being had to depart into the ether. Cerys' trickery and the witcher's cold blood had saved Udalryk, freeing him from his torment at long last.<br>
   1001952|00000000||Geralt decided to take care of the hym using tried and true witcher methods. This meant, as it often does, waiting until after dusk and gathering a generous supply of torches. Only then did he and Udalryk journey to the abandoned home to set about forcing the wraith to reveal its true visage. The fight lasted the entire night. Though at times Geralt feared Udalryk would not withstand the torture the hym dealt in its last throes of self-defense, by the time dawn came our heroes had triumphed and the hym had dissolved back into the ether.

   1051245|00000000||Ciri and I had promised Whoreson a heap of treasure in return for his help. When we failed to deliver, he kidnapped our friend Dudu and started torturing him - his way of prodding us to improve our performance.

Dudu could simply change form and melt into the crowd, but Ciri and I had to flee the city at breakneck speed, with Junior's strongmen on our heels the entire time.

   1062457|00000000||Philippa Eilhart, one-time advisor to King Vizimir II, called the Just, member of the Council of Mages and later founder of the Lodge of Sorceresses, had played a momentous part in the history of the world as well as in Geralt's life.<br><br>There could be no denying her talent, yet neither could one claim she did not also at times demonstrate sickly ambition. Very trustworthy reports indicated she had had a hand in King Vizimir II's death, and, as a member of the Lodge, was implicated in the murder of two other monarchs as well - Demavend of Aedirn and Foltest of Temeria.<br><br>For this reason the one-time "Jewel of the Court at Tretogor" was now a wanted woman, the quarry of special forces from the North and Nilfgaard alike.<br>
   1062458|00000000||Vizimir's son and successor, Radovid V, was particularly eager to capture her. During their last encounter in Loc Muinne he had had Philippa's eyes gouged out, yet she had fled and he wanted nothing more than to stick the head of "Tretegor's Jewel" on a spike above the city gates.<br>
   1062459|00000000||Thanks to her mastery of the difficult art of polymorphy, Philippa had been able to evade her pursuers by transforming into an owl. Then she had holed up in a hideout outside Novigrad to wait out the worst.<br>
   1062461|00000000||Everything seemed to indicate that Philippa had not only been investigating magic cures to her lost vision, but had also taken concrete steps towards the reactivation of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Her current location, however, remained unknown.<br>
   1062462|00000000||Imagine our surprise when we learned Philippa had been right under our noses the whole time! During her flight from her pursuers she had sought shelter with an old lover and fellow mage. He must've still born a grudge, however, for he tricked her and imprisoned her in her owl form. After the witch hunters carted him off, his house was plundered and the owl wound up in the hands of… our dear friend Zoltan. Sadly Triss discovered this right after Zoltan had lost the owl in a game of cards - meaning our search had to continue.<br>
   1062463|00000000||Philippa's new "owner"? Dijkstra. Was it a coincidence that she was now in the hands of her spurned-ex-lover and hated enemy? Triss certainly didn't think so, instead suspecting the former spy had woven a gwent-centered web of subterfuge in order to settle some old scores.<br>
   1062464|00000000||Luckily for Philippa, Geralt got things under control and saved her from whatever delights Dijkstra was planning.<br>
   1062465|00000000||Though the Lodge's prior actions were highly controversial, Philippa stubbornly worked towards its reconstitution, offering Ciri the chance to join it as a full and equal member.<br>
   1072871|00000000||One can call historical justice the fact that Philippa Eilhart, Radovid's old tutor, ended the crazed monarch's life. In doing so she also exacted revenge for her blinding and the death and persecution of her fellow mages, so many of whom had died in agony on Radovid's orders.

   1002639|00000000||When Ciri and Geralt reached Hindarsfjall, Ciri mentioned she wished to visit someone very special to her, a young man named Skjall who had helped her flee the Wild Hunt. Yennefer and Geralt exchanged grim looks and gave Ciri the tragic news: Skjall was dead. Fighting back tears, Ciri announced she was going to visit his grave.<br>
   1002640|00000000||It turned out brave Skjall was not treated with the respect he deserved after his death. His body was thrown in a ditch like a rotting animal carcass. Offended to her very core, Ciri pulled his corpse out of the ditch and buried it with Geralt's help near the cemetery. This violation of custom aroused the disgust and outrage of nearby Skelligers, to whom Skjall was a disgraced outcast. Ciri remained intransigent and refused to give any ground to local sensibilities. All in all, it was an unfortunate incident that could have been handled more, hm... delicately.

   1059043|00000000||Graham was a simple fisherman from an even simpler village, Oreton, yet the role he had played in local events was anything but. Fyke Isle, the tower, the curse—he had been a key part of it all. Geralt had learned from Anabelle about the deep feelings the two had shared, but the rest of their tragic story only emerged later…<br>
   1059044|00000000||Exactly how the young man had participated in the incident in the tower remained rather unclear. What was certain was that he tried to defend his beloved and fled Fyke Isle right after what he thought was her death…<br>
   1059045|00000000||Stories about poor fishermen in love with their lord's daughters are not wont to end happily, but even the most tragic-quilled poet would find what Graham and Anabelle experienced excessively cruel. Their desire for happiness and mutual love was defeated by the cruelty of fate and the greed of men, damning the young couple to eternal suffering – Graham without his love at his side, Anabelle as a tortured soul wandering between the living and the dead.<br><br>There was nothing left to the witcher but to bring the young man Anabelle's earthly remains, hoping that a proper burial would bring peace to the girl's spirit and lift the curse.<br>
   1059046|00000000||Yet though the evil spell was indeed broken, this story still did not have a happy ending. A devious ghost of the plague was freed, and Graham became its first victim…<br>
   1059047|00000000||Graham filled Geralt in on the rest of the story, one in which youthful longing for happiness lost out to fate's cruelties and human greed. Having learned there was a slim chance he could save his beloved's ghost, the fisherman set out at once to help the witcher lift the curse weighing down on the isle.<br>
   1059048|00000000||Yet though the evil spell was indeed broken, this story still did not have a happy ending. Despite his courage and dedication, Graham died while saving the one he had never ceased to love.<br>

   1051233|00000000||Deep in the swampy woods of Velen there is a roadside altar praising the glories of one of the forgotten gods. That is where Geralt encountered a shriveled, half-senile old man who claimed he could foretell the future and would read Geralt's fortune - for a small fee.<br>
   1051243|00000000||Geralt gave the soothsayer a bit of food, but the reading he received in return did not seem worth even this meager sum. The witcher was sorely disappointed.

   1085073|00000000||King Bran, former ruler of the Skellige Isles, lived a long and storied life. When he finally felt decrepitude take hold of him, he ventured into the woods to hunt a bear armed only with a knife - and thus ended his reign. He was remembered as an honorable and respected king, though some complained he preferred raiding to confronting the Isles' more intransigent problems, and that he let his wife's tongue wag too freely. Some connected the two, claiming Bran sailed out to fight overseas battles to put off dealing with the ones awaiting him at home.

   1077862|00000000||Evidence suggests cyclopses can live for an incredibly long time.

Its heft alone precludes effective use of the Aard Sign, while its enormous physical strength would make its blows particularly deadly. Cyclopses are most likely vulnerable to ogroid oil.

Síle always claimed she acted only out of concern for the good of magic and mankind, yet the blood of a great many people stained her hands, including that of kings who stood in the way of her aims. She took part in countless conspiracies and herself devised many intrigues in which the witcher often figured as an unwitting accomplice, obstacle or incidental victim.<br><br>Thus Geralt's prior meetings with the sorceress were stormy at best. On at least one occasion it could be said that Geralt saved Sile's life, but this did not mean he felt very warmly about her.<br><br>Be that as it may, the sight of the tortured and maimed sorceress in King Radovid's dungeon made the witcher's cold heart swell with sorrow and sympathy.
   1059056|00000000||Perhaps it was these feelings, or perhaps it was simply respect for a defeated former enemy now suffering at the hands of cruel fanatics, that made Geralt take pity on her.

   1059057|00000000||Yet Síle's wounds were serious - her life could not be saved. Time was running short, and so Geralt had to leave the dying sorceress to the fate that awaited her.<br>

   1062092|00000000||Witchers live to kill monsters, and so they place great importance on the weapons and armor they use. Bodily harm is all too common in this profession, so whenever the chance arises to acquire better work clothing, the thinking witcher pounces on it like a cat on a plump mouse. <br><br>Such a mouse skittered in front of Geralt's eyes at one point in the form of the dwarf Fergus, an armorer of great renown. The craftsman promised to forge top-notch equipment for our hero, but first he needed the appropriate tools. Geralt thus set out in search of them.<br>
   1062093|00000000||Geralt acquired the tools, but his adventure did not end there. In the meantime he learned Fergus' apprentice was the true master of the forge, and Fergus himself a mere figurehead. Apparently this arrangement came about because they thought no one would believe a woman could possess such talent. It seemed now the fickle apprentice had changed her mind and wished to assume her rightful place in the sun.<br><br>In order to prove her talent, she made Geralt do a bit of running around and act as an archer's target in a bizarre ordeal. Luckily, everything worked out and in the end our hero earned the gratitude of a true master armoress, who promised to forge him the best plate in the world.<br>
   1073878|00000000||Geralt acquired the tools, but in the end no armor would be forged with them. It turned out the real talent in the workshop belonged to Fergus' female understudy, the man himself being a mere figurehead there to assuage people who would never believe a woman could possess such talent. Geralt was asked to assist in proving this talent to all and sundry by acting as a human target of sorts - and this was too much for him. He refused to participate in this risky armor effectiveness trial, and thus the Nilfgaardian officer concluded Yoana was a fraud. After this, she packed up her things and left Velen for good. I hope, in the end, she found some place where they could appreciate her talent.
   1086985|00000000||During his travels, Geralt dropped by a certain forge and, while making conversation with the proprietor, asked whether the craftsman would be capable of forging equipment requiring the highest level of mastery.

   1060647|00000000||It turned out not only Geralt was looking for Cirilla. Also on her trail – a mysterious elven mage. Like the witcher, he had gone to Keira Metz to inquire after Ciri's whereabouts. During this conversation he also revealed that he kept a hideout in the ruins near the village of Midcopse.<br>
   1060648|00000000||Geralt decided to follow up on this lead. Though he was not able to establish the mysterious mage's identity, he did learn that he had been traveling with Cirilla some time before and the Wild Hunt was after him as well.<br>
   1060707|00000000||Geralt's investigation in Skellige unearthed evidence that the mysterious elven mage had protected Ciri from certain death at the hands of the Wild Hunt's warriors.<br>
   1060708|00000000||As expected, the investigation Geralt and Yennefer conducted in Skellige unearthed valuable information about Ciri. Most interesting of all, they learned Ciri had not fled the Wild Hunt alone, but in the company of a mysterious elven mage.<br><br>It was only thanks to his intervention that Ciri was able to slip out of the ghastly riders' grasp.<br>
   1060709|00000000||Geralt learned that Ciri and her mysterious companion were separated upon arrival in Velen. Like Geralt, the mage had gone to Keira Metz and inquired after Ciri's whereabouts. During this conversation he also revealed that he kept a hideout in the ruins near the village of Midcopse.<br>
   1060710|00000000||Geralt decided to follow up on this lead. Though he was not able to establish the mysterious mage's identity, the message the elf had left made it clear he had known Cirilla for quite some time.<br>
   1060711|00000000||Skjall's words drew a new detail onto the emerging picture of the mage. After the Wild Hunt's attack, Skjall had seen Ciri and a mysterious elf sail away from Skellige, their course set for the high seas.

   1085134|00000000||Ciri encountered plenty of liars, scoundrels and villains along her path - but luckily happened on some decent folk as well. Certainly worthy of being counted among the latter was Skjall, a young warrior from Lofoten. Initially, he and his family tended to Ciri's wounds, nursed her back to health, then he helped her flee the Wild Hunt. In doing so, he sacrificed the thing Skelligers hold dearest: his honor. Accused of cowardice, he was forced to perform a heroic deed to clear his name. Sadly, he failed. Mortally wounded by a beast in an abandoned garden, he suffered a slow, painful and lonely death.<br>
   1085074|00000000||Ciri could not restore Skjall's life or even clear his unjustly sullied reputation - but at least she was able to give him a proper burial. Skellige legend holds that Skjall's soul now dines with his ancestors in the Heavenly Feast Hall, where mead flows in torrents and the ballads never cease. Though my own nature does not tend towards the religious, I must admit I would very much like this to be true.

   1078477|00000000||Geralt decided to search the wrecked ships and found a great deal of precious cargo. Luckily neither the locals nor monsters attracted to shiny objects had managed to rob them beforehand.

   1019225|00000000||This monster - I'm intrigued. What kind of beast we talking about?
   1019227|00000000||It's a ghost, I think… Or some other nightmare. Haunts Eldberg, near the lighthouse.
   1017049|00000000||Mhm. Been there. Does look serious… Go on.
   1019282|00000000||Started harmless. Lighthouse just stopped burnin' one night. Without that light, ships can't make Arinbjorn safely, so we sent two men to see what'd happened.
   1019284|00000000||Lemme guess. They didn't come back.
   1019286|00000000||Naye, they didn't. Mikkjal, the light keeper, he'd also gone missin'. So I gathered some lads, a rescue party, and off we sailed… As we neared the isle, I hit the rudder hard and turned 'round. I'd seen a wraith on shore.
   1019288|00000000||Must think me a coward. But… well, crude steel'd not do us much good there, I felt it in me bones. All I could think to do was to gather gold 'round the village for a reward. Help us and it's yours.

   1017073|00000000||Thank ye, Geralt. You're a good sort, oughta be said.

   1019293|00000000||Gotta say I like you, Jorund… But business is business. I'll need more than that.
   1068411|00000000||That much? Oh Geralt... Doubt the jarl'd be prepared to spit that up.
   1068413|00000000||Hm… I can add a sum, but not near that much.
   1068417|00000000||Ye know, Geralt, I don't rightly believe we're headed for agreement. So ye either take the offer or the grief when the gold goes to another.
   1068415|00000000||Grand, let's call it that. Shake on it.

   1052553|00000000||Before Geralt and Yennefer parted after their adventure in Freya's garden, the sorceress asked him to meet her in Larvik. She made it clear this was a personal matter, but gave no further details.<br>
   1052554|00000000||Geralt duly traveled to Larvik, where Yennefer revealed to him her plan: she intended to capture a djinn and draw on its power. Brrr, the very thought of it makes my skin crawl and my throat constrict! For, dear reader, I have had the misfortune of dealing with a djinn once in my life, and I assure you - once was one time too many. Most djinns, you see, combine incredible power with a mean streak a mile long. In short, they are nasty beings that prudent people should steer well clear of. <br><br>Yet when Yennefer sets her sights on something, there's no turning back. Geralt glumly realized this and decided to help her handle the dangers that would surely arise during this mad endeavor. Yennefer had managed to learn about a certain scholar who had devoted his entire life to delving into the secrets of djinns. He had died in mysterious circumstances during a shipwreck off the coast of Hindarsfjall. That is where Geralt and Yennefer decided to begin their search.<br>
   1052580|00000000||The trail they followed took Geralt and Yennefer from the bottom of the sea off the coast of Hindarsfjall to the snowy peaks towering above Ard Skellig. There, barging recklessly in where even dragons should fear to tread, they summoned the djinn and tried to capture it. The djinn, however, had no intention of giving up without a fight and resisted with all its strength.<br><br>Together witcher and sorceress managed to pin this feisty spirit. Once it understood its situation was hopeless, Yennefer could convince it to do what she wanted - release Geralt and her from the spell another djinn had cast on them long ago. This spell had made it so that Geralt and Yennefer, despite their many differences, could not live without each other. Now they had a chance to see if, once the spell was no longer in effect, the magic between them would still persist...<br>
   1052644|00000000||The truth did not disappoint. The captured djinn dispelled its predecessor's work… and the feelings between Geralt and the sorceress burned on as fiery as ever. Many an admirer breathed a heavy sigh on that day, when the bond between these two renowned beauties closed tight, crushing all outsiders' hopes...
   1052668|00000000||The truth came as a brutal shock to Yennefer, though she was not the kind to let this show. After the djinn dispelled its predecessor's work, Geralt confessed that he no longer felt towards her what he once had. Hearts heavy, they returned to Kaer Trolde and then went their separate ways.
   1087038|00000000||Though Yennefer had made it clear the matter was important to her, Geralt made it equally clear he was in no mood to be her errand boy yet again. He left her in Skellige and returned to his own affairs.

   1053903|00000000||An abandoned home, or even an abandoned village, was no rare sight in the Velen of those days, but a certain set of ruins attracted Geralt's particular attention. He decided to find out what exactly was responsible for the manor's sorry state.<br>
   1053904|00000000||A Novigrad merchant told Geralt about a mage named Aeramas. The poor man had, like so many of his colleagues, met a gruesome death on a pyre. With no surviving heirs, his expansive rural residence was now abandoned - and, if the rumors about this eccentric sorcerer were true, inside it awaited a great many curiosities and valuable secrets...<br>
   1053905|00000000||Geralt searched the abandoned residence from top to bottom. Among the assorted worthless trinkets, he found some true treasures which Aeramas had cleverly hid from the world by setting murderous cheeses as guards. Tyromancers are not normally the cheery sort, but Aeramas certainly would have been delighted to know that his treasure had ended up in good hands.
   1070685|00000000||Geralt investigated Aeramas' estate and discovered the mage had been a raring tyromancy enthusiast - tyromancy being, as you surely know, the art of divining the future from cheese. This is a very rare specialization among mages, one only practiced by those for whom a social life is not a high priority - there reason being that the cheese they use to divine with is, and pardon my blunt language, fouler smelling than a drowner's scrotum. No wonder Aeramas' home hadn't been looted.<br>

   1051296|00000000||Once Geralt had helped both Lambert and Eskel, Yennefer was ready to lift Uma's curse. Yet in a surprise twist, Vesemir demanded they wait. The old witcher wanted to try his own, less risky method before the sorceress went about her invasive business. The others all bowed to his seniority and wisdom and let him take Uma to treat as he wished - leaving them with an unexpectedly free evening to fill. Eskel timidly suggested they spend this time productively, but this suggestion lost out to a more attractive alternative - a night of drink and camaraderie.<br>
   1051298|00000000||During their well-lubricated gathering Yennefer finally revealed her plan to the witchers: if Vesemir proved unable to lift Uma's curse, she would subject the being to the Trials of Grasses. These were the exceptionally dangerous and painful alchemical procedures young boys used to be forced to undergo in order to become witchers. It is no wonder, then, that Yennefer's intentions proved highly controversial. The sorceress defended her idea, holding that only by preparing Uma's body in this drastic way would it be able to survive the shock of lifting the curse. This upsetting news needed to be properly digested. And so, after Yennefer went to sleep, the witchers turned to the tried and true digestive-aiding powers of hard alcohol, card playing and the recounting of ribald tales.<br>

This unsettling news needed time to be properly digested, and so the witchers broke out a few more bottles and exchanged some stories with Yennefer before heading to bed. They had a very big day ahead of them - a day in which they just might find Ciri.<br>
   1062502|00000000||Yet even a witcher's body can only handle so much toxicity - and once this limit is passed, one must prepare for the unusual and the disturbing, a fact Hierarch Hemmelfart learned first-hand.<br>

   1055046|00000000||Though druids have gained fame worldwide as outstanding healers, even with all their spells and elixirs they at times prove powerless against diseases. Such was the case with Egill - a druid who had lost his voice. His friend decided that, since traditional methods had failed, it was time to try newer, more innovative approaches. It fell to Geralt to test them.<br>
   1055047|00000000||Thanks to Geralt's efforts, Egill did indeed speak once more - in order to give Geralt a thorough tongue lashing. It turned out the druid had not lost his voice due to illness, but had sworn a vow of silence for religious reasons. Instead of helping a man to recover, it seemed Geralt had taken part in a rather awful practical joke.

   1055060|00000000||Hubert Rejk seemed like a kind, gentle and accommodating man - but in truth he was a bloodthirsty, brutal and murderous vampire, hiding a twisted and fanatical mind behind his never-changing mask of eternal youth. Geralt cut him down after an extraordinarily difficult duel, avenging my Priscilla's suffering and saving the lives of the countless others who surely would have died by this base monster's hands.<br>
   1055056|00000000||Telling this story, my dear reader, will tax me greatly. It is a dark and somber one, encompassing the greatest sorrow my heart has ever known. It all started the day of the grand opening of my cabaret. Everything had been spit-polished to perfection - all that was left was to wait for Priscilla, whose performance was to be the crowning moment of this glorious evening. Yet when the doors of the Chameleon burst open it was not she who stepped inside. Instead, it was a messenger from the Vilmerius Hospital. His face pale and his countenance dour, he informed us Priscilla had been badly wounded in an assault - and was currently tottering on the brink of death.<br>
   1055059|00000000||Geralt's investigation took him to Crippled Kate's, a pleasure house of questionable repute. It is there, according to the note left by the murderer in Patricia Vegelbud's body, that the fiend would take his next victim - a prostitute named Sweet Nettie.<br><br>Geralt entered her room and found the Reverend Nathaniel, whom he had met earlier at the morgue, inside. The situation was clear - Nathanial was standing over Nettie with a white-hot poker in his hand - so Geralt meted out justice to this cruel and perverted man without batting an eye.<br>

   1055061|00000000||Sadly, though Nathaniel was guilty of many sins, serial killing was not among them. Some time after his death Geralt happened across the body of another victim, one mutilated in an all-too-familiar way. This time, however, the murderer had learned from experience and wiped all possible clues to his identity. The witcher thus could not catch him, and the death of countless innocents, and my Priscilla's suffering, went unavenged.
   1087099|00000000||How great was my gratitude when Geralt rushed off after that hideous fiend who had done such harm to my Priscilla! Yet days passed, and the witcher never returned with updates on the progress of his investigation. Soon enough, I had to confront the fact that we would never catch the degenerate scoundrel. Strengthened by Priscilla's improving condition, I focused instead on the hope that one day she and I would sing together in beautiful duet once more...

   1059023|00000000||When the children in the swamp clearing first told Geralt about Johnny, the witcher had every reason to suppose no such person actually existed. It was difficult to believe anyone could live in such inhospitable surroundings without quickly becoming food for drowners or water hags.<br><br>Geralt thus suspected Johnny was the figment of childish imaginations, an imaginary friend for lonely orphans. Long years of experience, however, told him not to ignore any possible trail, and so he decided to search for this Johnny in the nearby swamplands.<br>
   1059037|00000000||It turned out the orphans were not lying - Johnny really did exist. He was not a human child but a godling, one of a rare breed of creatures that can be found scattered about the Continent's wildernesses.<br><br>Unfortunately Johnny had lost his voice in circumstances he obviously could not explain, and so neither could he provide much in the way of answers to Geralt's questions.<br>
   1059038|00000000||Once Geralt had helped him regain his voice, however, he talked up a veritable storm, giving the lie to all the tales of these legendary beings' supposed shyness. Johnny also agreed to convince Gran to put Geralt in touch with the Ladies of the Wood.<br>

   1050772|00000000||Witchers should be neutral, avoid meddling in the affairs of others. But at times, it's hard to be indifferent… While searching for Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir stopped by the tavern in the village of White Orchard. When a row erupted in the establishment soon afterwards, Vesemir decided to defend the besieged innkeep. Unfortunately, instead of calming the situation, he inflamed it. The witchers were forced to draw their steel swords. Those they use to kill humans.<br>
   1050773|00000000||They say idioms are the wisdom of nations. But the saying "With many against one, even a witcher's done" rarely proves true. Though their foes held the advantage in numbers, Geralt and Vesemir tended to them handily. Unfortunately, the innkeeper they had sought to protect hardly appreciated the gesture. Terrified at the bloody massacre, she tossed her saviors out the door.

   1051294|00000000||The task of preparing the phylactery fell to Lambert, to his great dissatisfaction. His discontent came as no surprise to me when I learned of it - Lambert was not the most obliging of fellows, and Yennefer, well, let us just say she was not his favorite individual. Nevertheless, Lambert agreed to do the job, and Geralt felt he had no choice but to accompany him.<br>
   1051295|00000000||Geralt and Lambert braved the dangerous path to the Circle of Elements, which took them across a drowner- and foglet-infested lake, through the cave in which Old Speartip slept, and over mountain passes home to mistrustful and treacherous rock trolls. Along the way all the differences between Geralt and his younger comrade were exposed in sharp contrast. Sparks flew between them more than once, and biting commentary and barbed remarks were the order of the day. Geralt tolerated Lambert's prickliness with admirable stoicism, for he knew that the younger witcher's famous sarcasm served only to cover his many deeply-felt, never-healed wounds.

   1077921|00000000||<i>We never hunt in these woods. Never. Even if it means the whole village starves.</i><br>– Mulliver, ealdorman of Hoshberg in lower Aedirn<br><br>Leshens dwell in dense, primeval woods. Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within their territory – and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Leshens old enough to earn the appellation "ancient" wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.<br>
   1077922|00000000||In some areas of the world these creatures form the center of local cults. Peasants living near their woods make offerings to them, usually of hares and birds, though human blood is not unheard of. This fact has given rise to many legends about helpful leshens chasing game towards hunters, helping lost travelers find their way in the forest or saving them from bandits. Sadly, these tales do not have an ounce of truth in them. Leshens see men only as sources of energy on which to feed. They will drain the life force of those who live nearby until only limpid husks remain.<br><br>Some leshens create magic totems that increase their strength – in such cases these totems should be destroyed before or while fighting them. Furthermore, some leshens can create for themselves a kind of immortality in the following way: the leshen wounds a lost traveler passing through its woods with its claws and casts a black magic curse on him. For as long as the individual marked in this way stays near its territory, the leshen will be reborn every time it dies. Such leshens can only be defeated by driving away or killing the person they have marked.<br><br>In combat leshens use not only their long claws but also their many allies: wolves, who unfailingly answer their call, or ravens, which harass and distract the leshen's opponent. Leshens are also able to bend plant life to their will and make it aid them in battle. It is a witcher's good fortune that leshens do have one weakness - they are extremely vulnerable to the Igni Sign.

   1061608|00000000||We met Joachim von Gratz, chief surgeon at Vilmerius Hospital, in very unfortunate circumstances. My Priscilla had been attacked and he was tending to her wounds.<br><br>I must admit I was so shaken up I hardly remember our first meeting, save that he was a cool-headed doctor who seemed to know a great deal about the previous murders and offered his help investigating the matter.<br>
   1061609|00000000||It seemed that the surgeon was no stranger to violence, for he bore a formidable scar worthy of a veteran of Brenna.<br>
   1061610|00000000||Geralt also noted that Von Gratz seemed quite experienced at navigating the sewers and fighting the monsters dwelling within it.<br>
   1061611|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.<br>
   1061612|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not get along with the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.

   1061613|00000000||The coroner confirmed what his former student claimed, yet added an additional detail - he had made his denunciation only after von Gratz's activities had resulted in several deaths.<br>
   1061614|00000000||In the end von Gratz was eliminated as a suspect, but like Geralt he had to admit defeat in his attempts to outwit the psychopathic murderer.<br>

   1061633|00000000||The dwarves have been in the banking business since the legendary King Desmond of Temeria was just a snot-nosed brat in short trousers asking for more "yam" with his "bwed."

   1060987|00000000||It can be difficult for a woman to gain the esteem of knights and warriors not accustomed to seeing female hands on the reins of power. It helps little when, like Birna, widow of King Bran of Skellige, the woman seeking power is filled with acrid disdain for her countrymen and their customs. One might aruge that disdain is a valid reaction when, in the case of the passing of a man of power who embodies tradition, those customs call on her to follow long since outdated ritual and cast herself on her husband's funeral pyre.<br><br>Justified or not, Birna's desire to rewrite age-old Skellige traditions put her at odds with the jarls and made it unlikely she would be remembered alongside Calanthe of Cintra or Meve of Lyria as a successful and revered ruler.<br>
   1060988|00000000||Birna likewise refused to hide her disgust with the custom of choosing a ruler by vote of the jarls. She dreamed of establishing a hereditary kingship in Skellige and thought the ideal dynasty to hold it was her own, starting with her and Bran's son, the young Svanrige.<br>
   1060989|00000000||In all probability it was this longing for power that drove Birna to concoct the conspiracy that ended in the massacre at Kaer Trolde.<br>
   1060990|00000000||The evidence gathered by Geralt and Cerys sealed Birna's fate.<br>
   1060993|00000000||Birna fulfilled her dream of placing her son on the throne of Skellige, but her plans to control Svanrige's every action were foiled. The freshly-crowned king quickly made it clear he would rule on his own.

This time, however, the shoe was on the other foot: a certain Hans of Cidaris, a soldier of fortune by trade, had made it known far and wide that he would pay a handsome sum to whoever could defeat the beast that had made its nest in the forest outside Oxenfurt. Geralt decided to take on the job.<br>
   1051372|00000000||Mercenaries are usually the ones getting paid for killing things.

Geralt decided to accept this contract.<br>
   1051373|00000000||While passing through the area around Oxenfurt, Geralt came across tracks left by a dangerous monster. Though he had not received any contract for this beast, he nevertheless decided to follow its trail.<br>
   1051374|00000000||Geralt's investigation led him to conclude that an archgriffin had taken up residence in the ravine.

   1051375|00000000||Geralt defeated the beast - and discovered a highly interesting document in its lair.

The Crones of Crookback Bog are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. <br><br>Common folk have given these three sisters the names Weavess, Brewess and Whispess, and call the whole threesome "The Ladies of the Wood," or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of Velen, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.<br><br>The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.

   1015155|00000000||Welcome.
   1062575|00000000||A hard life awaits the child who cannot escape his parents' shadow. Following the death of his father, the beloved King Bran, Svanrige became the formal ruler of Clan Tuirseach, which controlled vast territory on the isle of An Skellig.<br><br>Yet this quiet and mild-mannered young man seemed firmly tied to the apron strings of his mother, Birna, who sought to control his every waking deed. With such an overbearing caretaker it was hard to imagine how Svanrige could ever grow into a man able to rule a mighty Skellige clan in his own right.<br>
   1062576|00000000||Svanrige's election as ruler of Skellige was a rather unexpected turn of events. It was widely thought to have been the result of backroom maneuvering by Birna, who used the chaos in the aftermath of the other claimants' deaths and the shame that fell on the an Craites to achieve her ambition of placing a puppet in her control on the Skellige throne.<br>
   1062577|00000000||It thus came as a great shock for her when young Svanrige showed his claws and tore up the humiliating treaty with Nilfgaard she wanted him to sign - and then washed the shame of this near-submission from the isles with the blood of their eternal enemy. This blood simultaneously wiped away any doubts whether the new king was worthy of the crown.<br>

   1050775|00000000||During his travels through No Man's Land Geralt ran into the pellar once more. The strange fellow had a favor to ask of the witcher. He wanted Geralt to help him perform a cherished local peasant rite known as Forefathers' Eve. During this ritual, he explained, lost spirits are summoned and their deeds judged - fantastic material, by the way, for a poet looking to make his name with an atmospheric ballad. This Forefathers' Eve was set to be held at midnight on Fyke Isle, and Geralt, having no other plans and his curiosity piqued, promised to attend.<br>
   1050789|00000000||On Fyke Isle the pellar led the witcher through the arcane rites that marked the opening of Forefathers' Eve. Alas and alack, uninvited guests then arrived and threatened to break up the ritual before its conclusion. The witch hunters considered what the peasants practiced on Fyke Isle to be vile necromancy, and demanded they stop it at once.<br>
   1050795|00000000||Witchers do their best to remain neutral, and so Geralt felt he should not get involved in what was, in the end, a dispute between humans. He thus did not lift a finger as the witch hunters scattered the peasants and brought the ritual to a premature conclusion.<br>
   1050796|00000000||Abandoning his rule of not taking sides in others' affairs, the witcher chose to defend the ritual's participants. Predictably, this did not please the witch hunters one bit. A bloody fight broke out on Fyke Isle, and though it ended in victory for Geralt, it had a disastrous effect on the rest of the ritual.<br>
   1050798|00000000||Geralt had defended the peasants from the witch hunters' persecution, but spilled much blood in order to do so, sullying the sacred ground. Forefathers' Eve could not continue, but the pellar had one more request for Geralt. He wanted him to find and burn the body of Old Ambros. This man was the pellar's father, a cruel brute who returned from the dead to continue tormenting his son. Burning the body was a way to resolve the pellar's issues with his father and send the ghost of Old Ambros into the nether realms for good.<br>
   1050797|00000000||As you can imagine, the pellar was not pleased by Geralt's indifference in the face of the witch hunters' persecution. Many a bitter word was uttered and then each went his own way.
    559146|00000000||Meet the pellar in the stone circle on Fyke Isle at midnight.

   1051270|00000000||Geralt had learned that Rosa var Attre was a passionate devotee of the art of swordplay. The fencing lesson Geralt had given her while searching for yours truly had thrilled her to the core - and left her asking the witcher if they could meet again for a repeat. Geralt had plenty of experience teaching young women with fiery personalities how to swing swords and so agreed.<br>
   1051271|00000000||Once they were done with their lesson Geralt was supposed to escort the young lady home. Rosa, however, was clearly still in the mood for some recreation and gave him the slip during a moment of inattention. The witcher knew he needed to find her - or land himself in a heap of trouble.<br>
   1051272|00000000||Rosa found out for herself that not all residents of Novigrad respect diplomatic immunity. The witcher saved her from a tight spot - but also discovered a dark side to her character. It was clear to them both that there would be no third fencing lesson.

   1055116|00000000||The Vegelbud family's out-of-town estate was famed not only for its lovely guardians and sumptuous banquets, but also for the series of horse races organized there in honor of one of the line's illustrious ancestors, Erasmus. Geralt, who had spent a great many years in the saddle, decided to test his mettle in this derby - lured, perhaps, by the sizable reward promised to the victor.<br>
   1055117|00000000||The Vegelbud races segued into an unexpected encore. Cleaver, one of the Novigrad  crime lords, was so impressed by the witcher's riding prowess that he offered him the chance to take part in the equally famed (though illegal) race organized by the local underworld.<br>
   1055118|00000000||Though the nighttime race was rife with obstacles, Geralt managed to win it as well. Sadly, he was not given long to celebrate his triumph, for the city guard, alarmed by the ruckus of galloping horses at an hour when decent people should be asleep, broke up the event and scattered its participants.

   1051874|00000000||With the witcher's help I was able to make my castle in the clouds a heaven on earth - I opened my cabaret and called it The Chameleon. Ah, if you'd only seen the pride in Priscilla's eyes when our hard-working dwarven remodelers hung that reptile-adorned signboard above our doors! What a tragic shame later events did not go at all as we had dreamed...
   1051873|00000000||Ever since that fateful eve near twenty years ago when my dear friend Geralt and I visited a no-longer-extant cabaret in the once-beautiful city of Oxenfurt, I have longed with every fiber of my being to become the owner of just such an establishment. When Alonso Wily, more commonly known as Whoreson Senior, left me the Rosemary and Thyme in his will, my dreams finally began to assume a more concrete form. When Priscilla lent her support to the endeavor, the scales tipped decidedly towards action and the ball threatened to start rolling. I needed just a few things more to begin my planned remodeling of the Rosemary and Thyme into a cabaret - and so I turned to Geralt, the fiercest fetcher in the world.<br>
   1085025|00000000||At last I was free - and never had the nectar of liberty tasted so sweet. No matter how I slurped, I could not imbibe it fast enough. I filled every waking hour, and quite a few sleeping ones, with fevered activity - there was so much to do, and so little time in which to do it! Since the witcher had proven a true and reliable friend time and time again, I asked him for help, and he readily agreed to provide it.
   1087093|00000000||So it goes with Geralt - often he burns with eager enthusiasm at first, only to then have the fires wane and his interest stray elsewhere. Despite his promises to assist me in putting together my cabaret, in the end he saw to other matters instead - and without his help, I was unable to get the job done. Oh well - perhaps one day, when times are more settled, I'll remind him he owes me help starting a cabaret.

   1050920|00000000||The common folk rarely show witchers the gratitude they deserve for practicing their dangerous trade. Arinbjorn, however, proved an even more ungrateful place than usual in this regard. After taking care of a wraith plaguing this village, Geralt stepped into the local tavern in search of a well-earned drink. Before he could even take a sip, however, two trouble-seeking youths started harassing him. Geralt usually strives to avoid bloodshed in such situations... but this time he had no choice.<br>
   1050921|00000000||Though Geralt had killed his attackers in self-defense, no witnesses confirmed this and he was charged with starting the brawl. The inhabitants of Arinbjorn urged Geralt to put down his weapons and hand himself over to the jarl, Madman Lugos. Wanting no more blood on his hands that day, Geralt reluctantly delivered himself to the justice of a lunatic.<br>
   1050922|00000000||Geralt stood before Madman Lugos to be tried. The jarl found him guilty, but then immediately paid his blood price for him, thus giving him his freedom. In this way Lugos repaid the witcher for the help he had given his son in the Cave of Dreams.
   1050960|00000000||Geralt stood before Madman Lugos to be tried. The jarl found him guilty, but then immediately paid his blood price for him, thus giving him his freedom.

For saving his life and granting him his freedom, Lugos wanted Geralt to help his son and heir, Blueboy Lugos, in his trek through the mysterious Cave of Dreams.

   1061142|00000000||Many brave warriors answered Hjalmar's call to join him in reconquering Undvik from the Ice Giant. Among them - Folan, son of Ulf, Hjalmar's frequent comrade in battle and dear childhood friend. Folan, a member of Clan Tuirseach, was a fearless sailor and an unequaled archer, and so did not hesitate to join this dangerous expedition that stood to shower him in glory.<br><br>It would have ended horribly for him, however, had the witcher not kept his wits about him and saved him from the clutches of hungry trolls by winning a riddle contest.<br>
   1061143|00000000||Folan proved his skill with a bow by riddling the Ice Giant with arrows during the final fight against the colossus, a deed recounted to this day during Kaer Trolde feasts.<br>
   1061144|00000000||In order to pay the White Wolf back for saving his life, Folan set out with Hjalmar defend Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt. There, far from his native land, Folan fell in battle while fighting side by side with his friends.

   1077718|00000000||I've stopped the bleeding. I need to collect my thoughts.<br><br>I could go for help. There's a village not far, I can hear dogs barking. But people would see what uniform I wear. They'd ask what I was doing in the swamps. They'd figure it out. They'd take everything, maybe kill me. This is Velen, after all.<br><br>I've lost a quart of blood. Maybe more. If the wound is still clean come dawn, I should pull through. I'll leave at daylight, maybe then the drowners won't attack. I'll bury the treasure and head to Novigrad. Should be able to find a decent man there to patch me up. Someone who won't ask questions. Who doesn't care if you're a deserter.<br><br>All that's left to me now is to pray that no one sees the tracks I left. That they don't follow the blood trail and find the treasure. But no one will come through here. I hope. Everything will be fine.<br>
   1077719|00000000||It seems the wounded deserter never made it to Novigrad nor decided to ask the nearby villagers for help. Instead, he died alone in the swamp, leaving behind his treasure. The witcher mourned his tragedy, but rejoiced in his own good luck.

   1077712|00000000||<i>Now finish your soup, or a berserker'll come and swallow ye whole.</i><br>– Skellige mother scolding a child.<br><br>Skellige legends speak of men known as berserkers who transform into bears when overwhelmed by battle rage. In doing so, they lose all self-awareness and are driven by a bloodlust which they must satiate in order to return to human form. Few believe these blood-curdling tales, however, not even in Skellige, where the inhabitants usually treat even the least probable legends with the utmost gravity. This indicates either that berserkers are in fact mere figments of mead-sodden imaginations, or else that they have learned to hide their abilities from the rest of the islanders.<br>
   1077713|00000000||The skalds' ballads indicate a berserker transformed in the heat of battle cannot be distinguished from a true-born bear. Only minute anatomical details - such as the shape of their tongues and teeth - reveal their secret. Descriptions of their fighting prowess paint them as invulnerable to pain and able to heal any wound received almost at once.<br><br>If these men-turned-bears truly do exist, one can suppose that, like werewolves and lycanthropes, they are particularly vulnerable to oils that harm cursed creatures. But if we are to give credence to ancient songs about these creatures' deeds, about the mass murders and massacres they have committed, we can only hope that no witcher will have to test this hypothesis.

   1077928|00000000||<i>Chorts are smaller than fiends, true. But still big enough to kill.</i><br>– Agnes Thistle, herbalist from the Black Forest<br><br>Chorts are the somewhat smaller kin of fiends and bumbakvetches.  Yet any witcher who thinks their diminutive stature means they present no danger commits a grave error – the kind that can end his career permanently. These denizens of dark and ancient woods are some of the most dangerous monsters known to man.<br>
   1077929|00000000||Legends often mistake chorts for sylvans, ascribing to them the ability to speak, stand on two legs, gobble up cabbage, play pranks and work mischief around the household. The arrival of a true chort in a region soon puts an end to such tales. The creatures do not speak, at best communicating with each other through grunts, snorts and moans. They get about on four legs and as for their "mischief"... they destroy farmsteads, devouring anything that can be devoured, including cabbage, if such is available, but also extending to poultry, pork, the family dog and then the family itself. <br><br>Chorts fight with little finesse, running straight towards their opponent and trying to knock him to the ground with the force of their charge. After downing their foe they bite, kick and strike with their claw-tipped paws. Due to their size and four-legged posture, they are mostly unperturbed by the force of the Aard Sign, and the regenerative powers of their body allow any wounds they receive to heal at a rapid pace.  <i></i>

    488038|00000000||Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon – what can I possibly say about her? That we call her Ciri for short, that she was born in 1251, that she has ashen hair and a scar on her cheek?<br><br>All true, and that's the Cirilla I know best, the one I first laid eyes upon those many years ago, the one who seemed thoroughly, well, not ordinary, but certainly not as extraordinary as she in fact is.<br><br>For Cirilla is also a highly-skilled witcher, heiress to several thrones, the last bearer of the Elder Blood, a powerful Source endowed with exceptional magic talent and the Lady of Time and Space. Her hair color and date of birth seem... rather incidental now, don't they? <br><br>I could also tell you she is Geralt's adopted daughter – but that would be a gross simplification. Ciri is much more. She is his Destiny, his Unexpected Child, someone bound to the witcher by Fate's most inextricably tangled fetters. <br><br>Following age-old witcher tradition, Geralt took Ciri to Kaer Morhen when she came into his care. There he and Vesemir taught her in the ways of the professional monster slayer. It was then that her magic talents were first revealed, and they discovered she was a Source. <br>Ciri's gift proved a curse as well. Because of it, she would one day have to hide from the entire world – even Geralt.
    492593|00000000||Ciri's biography contained one more great secret. Her natural father was none other than the emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis. His words confirmed the fears swirling in Geralt's mind. Ciri had returned and was in mortal danger, for the unrelenting Wild Hunt was on her trail.<br>
   1062528|00000000||Yennefer made it clear why the Wild Hunt wanted Ciri: Eredin wanted the power latent in her Elder Blood. She also let Geralt know that Ciri had been seen in war-ravaged Velen as well as in Novigrad, the largest city in the world.<br>
   1062529|00000000||Reports that Ciri had spent time at Crow's Perch proved true. She was there as the guest of the local warlord, Phillip Strenger, also known as the Bloody Baron. Despite his violent moniker, this man treated Ciri with kindness and respect.<br>
   1062530|00000000||It seemed that during Ciri's time in Velen she got into a quarrel with some sort of witch or witches in the swamps.<br>
   1062531|00000000||Geralt learned the truth of Ciri's time in the swamps from the mouths of the hideous Crones themselves. Even Ciri, better able to hold her own than most anyone in existence, was lucky to escape from these powerful beings alive and intact.<br>
   1062532|00000000||The visions revealed by the Mask of Uroboros made it clear beyond all doubt: Ciri had played a role in the magic catastrophe on Ard Skellig. More importantly, they confirmed she had been in Skellige - and then fled in the face of grave danger.<br>
   1062533|00000000||Ultimate, tangible proof of the truth that the emperor had spoken the truth about Ciri's pursuers came in the form of a corpse – one belonging to a warrior of the Wild Hunt. The Riders truly were on Ciri's trail.<br>
   1062536|00000000||In hindsight, putting Ciri in touch with Whoreson was not one of my brightest ideas. In my defense, I can only say that her situation was so perilous even the riskiest plan seemed better than inactivity.<br>
   1062537|00000000||After many adventures and mishaps, Geralt finally found Ciri on the Isle of Mists. When he crossed the threshold into the room in which she slumbered, the protective spell Avallac'h had cast upon her snapped under the sheer weight of their combined destinies. Geralt was reunited with his adopted daughter after years of separation and searching. No words can describe the joy he felt in that moment.<br>
   1062542|00000000||Avallac'h's prediction that the Wild Hunt would descend on Kaer Morhen as soon as Ciri arrived was proven true. All present spared no effort in defending her. In the end, though, it was she who defended them – through an outburst of unbridled power, the raw strength of her Elder Blood, she saved the protectors of Kaer Morhen from certain death.<br>
   1062543|00000000||Though it was Cirilla who convinced Geralt to go with her to exact vengeance on Imlerith, it was the witcher who stood against Vesemir's killer in a final duel. Ciri slay some evil that day, however, killing two of the three monstrous sisters who had usurped for themselves rule over Velen.<br>
   1062544|00000000||Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that. Standing face to face with him was surely one of the most difficult challenges she had ever undergone.<br>
   1062546|00000000||Ciri passed this trial with flying colors, but the fact that Geralt accepted payment for bringing her in for this talk caused her great pain.<br>
   1062545|00000000||Ciri emerged from this trial victorious, and with an enhanced awareness of how deeply and unconditionally Geralt, her adopted father, loved and cared for her.<br>
   1062547|00000000||Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that.  It was thus no surprise that Ciri did not even want to see him.<br>
   1062548|00000000||Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears I can conclude that she let the mistresses of magic know in clear terms that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.<br>
   1062551|00000000||Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears, I can conclude that, with a bit of help from Geralt, she let the mistresses of magic know that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.<br>
   1062550|00000000||A visit to Avallac'h's secret laboratory revealed facts that shook Ciri to her core. Though she had long known she was the last of Lara Dorren's line, the only remaining heir to the so-called Elder Blood, only know did she realize this line had been an object of unbroken interest to elven Sages and human mages for two centuries. Another blow came from the words of the arrogant she-elf, which rankled in her heart like a thorny bramble.<br>
   1062552|00000000||Though anger and hurt threatened to overwhelm her, Ciri did not give in to her emotions. Geralt's words helped her in this, leaving her with no doubt how precious she was to him.<br>
   1062553|00000000||Cirilla wanted to visit the grave of Skjall, the young man who had put his life and honor on the line to help her. Though purely symbolic, this gesture brought a modicum of much-needed comfort to her soul.<br>
   1062554|00000000||Eredin had perished - but the evil king's death only ever heralds the end in fairy tales. In our store, this meant it was time for Ciri to face her destiny. Only she possessed the power to stop the White Frost - the near mythical force which threatened not just our world, but countless others as well.<br>
   1062549|00000000||Though unleashing anger on inanimate objects might not be considered mature behavior, it definitely helps bring one relief. Ciri thus reached for this most simple of solutions.<br>

   1044120|00000000||Geralt's search for information about the baron's wife and daughter took him to the local pellar. One glance and he knew the man was highly eccentric - an impression only strengthened when the pellar announced he would not divine what had happened to Anna and Tamara until Geralt found Princess, his runaway goat. Having no other choice, Geralt set off on a wild goat chase.<br>
   1044125|00000000||As a knight errant will comb the rugged heart of the wilderness to find the object of his quest, so Geralt searched for Princess the goat in the woods around Blackbough.<br><br>In the end, he found the caprine fugitive and, protecting it from manifold dangers along the way, led it back to its delighted owner.

   1083270|00000000||Find Graham.
   1002061|00000000||A horrible curse had befallen Fyke Isle and the tower that stood upon it. Half a year prior, Lord Vserad had moved his court there, seeking shelter from approaching Nilfgaardian armies. While famine raged all around, the lord of Velen wallowed in excess and cared not a whit for his suffering vassals. The gods saw fit to punish him and, towards this end, cursed him. One day, a host of mice scurried into the tower and proceeded to devour everything, including Vserad, his court and his resident mage, Alexander.<br><br>The isle had been haunted since that day, and fishermen feared to sail the lake, putting yet another dent in the already battered local economy. The local peasants thus asked Keira to lift the curse, and she turned to the witcher for help. Enticed by Keira's charms and her promise of additional rewards, Geralt took on the task. The sorceress equipped him with a magic lamp he could use to commune with dead souls, gave him a firm pat on the rear for good luck and sent him off to lift the curse.<br>
   1002062|00000000||During his investigation of the isle, Geralt discovered the lord's daughter, Anabelle, was the key to lifting the curse. She had died along with the others and her spirit now roamed the tower's empty halls, trapped in this vale of tears by her love for a fisherman named Graham.<br><br>Geralt thought taking her remains to the fisherman would solve everything - but instead it led to catastrophe. Anabelle, he discovered, was not an unfortunate lost soul but a dangerous plague maiden. The wraith had tricked Geralt - when he removed Anabelle's remains from the tower the plague maiden was freed from her prison and ventured out into the world to spread disease and pestilence.<br>

Geralt lifted the curse by bringing Graham back to see his love, but the story did not end happily. The young man's kiss dispatched the wraith into eternal slumber, but killed Graham - for, as Geralt realized all too late, Anabelle's ghost had become a deadly plague maiden, a spectral sower of disease and pestilence.<br>

   1068142|00000000||Hm. Honestly, Ves' desire to save the villagers makes sense. What doesn't is your opposition to the plan.

   1068117|00000000||It's a serious question.
   1068119|00000000||A rhetorical one. So instead of waiting for an answer, just… enlighten me.
   1068122|00000000||Soldiers think tactically. They know when to strike, when to fall back. When to charge and when to hold.
   1068124|00000000||Ves finds this difficult. She's impulsive, hot-tempered. Yet in guerilla warfare, one false step and you're fucked.
   1068126|00000000||I confined her to the camp because I feared that sent out, she'd go rabid and make a mistake. I was right.
   1066139|00000000||Mentioned you have a problem.
   1068091|00000000||Mhm. It's Ves. She took a couple of the lads across the river. Plans to hit the Black Ones at Mulbrydale.
   1068095|00000000||So? Sounds about like what guerilla fighters do.
   1068097|00000000||Yes, when they are ordered to. Whereas I forbade her from leaving camp. Indefinitely.
   1066137|00000000||Mentioned you have a problem.

   1054275|00000000||Thanks to the lovely Priscilla, Geralt now knew Ciri and I had struck a deal with Whoreson Junior, one of the Big Four bosses of the Novigrad underworld. It seemed a simple matter of finding Whoreson, having a chat and getting out of him where to look for me. But in the Novigrad of the time nothing was simple, and nothing was as it seemed...<br>
   1054276|00000000||Fate is like a Novigrad prostitute - sometimes you get more than you bargained for. Geralt found Whoreson after a great deal of meandering, during which he realized the man he sought was scum of the worst variety. Because of Whoreson, Ciri had been wounded, I had landed in prison, and Dudu had been subjected to torture.<br><br>It thus came as no surprise that, once he had the information he wanted, Geralt killed the heinous man without batting an eye. Having achieved what he set out to do and lanced a particularly loathsome boil on the skin of humanity while he was at it, he went forth to pursue his new leads.<br>

   1061668|00000000||Geralt and I had known the doppler Dudu for years - from before the moment we had actually met him, in fact.<br><br>You see, we first unwittingly talked to him when he was in Novigrad impersonating another friend of mine, a halfling merchant named Dainty Biberveldt. Dudu had assumed Dainty's form to use the merchant's network of contacts for some business endeavors of his own.<br><br>Dainty was infuriated at first at his inability to locate the impostor who had inserted himself into his dealings, but when Dudu's investments began generating sizable returns, the halfling changed his tune. He took the doppler on as a partner, introducing him to everyone as his cousin, Dudu Biberveldt.<br>
   1061669|00000000||Geralt learned that Dudu had crossed Whoreson Junior, one of Novigrad's most ruthless crime bosses. That Dudu extracted himself from this predicament while only losing one eye should be considered a fortunate turn.<br>
   1061670|00000000||Ciri, Dudu and I had all embroiled ourselves in quite the fiasco, but unlike me, the doppler was not caught by the temple guard.<br>
   1061671|00000000||Dudu was a theater aficionado and frequent attendee of Irena's mummers' performances. Apparently he had even stepped in to replace indisposed mummers on several occasions - and, given his special abilities, proved himself a uniquely convincing understudy.<br>
   1061672|00000000||Finally, after a great deal of trouble and thanks to a clever ruse, Geralt was reunited with his old friend  - and a certain imprisoned poet's only hope.<br>
   1061673|00000000||To end Dudu's story, let me just say that, as usual, he found a way to land on his feet. Dudu disguised himself as his one-time adversary, Whoreson Junior, and took over his business, announcing it was going clean and investing all its ill-gotten wealth in a legal (and very profitable) overseas trading company.<br><br>In a way, you could say he was living the "Novigrad dream."

   1060505|00000000||The devil Fugas held a very prestigious and responsible position during the Crones' sabbath: that of goon restricting access to the peak. He in no way resembled Torque, the irritating but harmless "deovel" Geralt and I had encountered many, many years prior.<br><br>Fugas' size resembled that of a somewhat overgrown troll, and he likewise displayed a troll's lack of subtlety. There was not a jot of mischievous puck or cunning verbal trickster about this "devil." Instead, he carried out his task with the commitment and professionalism of a Novigrad bouncer.<br><br>Trying to stop Geralt, though, turned out to be Fugas' dumbest and final idea, ending both his life and his flourishing career in the Crones' employ.

   1061156|00000000||Reverend Nathaniel, supervisor of the city morgue and cleric of the Eternal Fire, was a man with a vile character - and a stormy past. Before he donned the frock he had served for years as the city torturer.<br><br>One would be hard pressed to find a worse candidate for a pastor than a former hangman - but, as the saying goes, in Novigrad, anything is possible.<br>
   1061157|00000000||To say that Geralt caught Nathaniel red-handed would be an ill-considered pun. Nevertheless, the situation in which Geralt found him clearly indicated this was the man behind the recent wave of killings and so the witcher struck him down in a swift act of justice.<br>
   1061158|00000000||Afterwards, however, a new victim's body was found and Nathaniel's name was cleared - well, of the killings, that is, for nothing could absolve this priest of his countless other sins.
   1061159|00000000||To say Geralt caught Nathaniel red-handed would be an ill-considered pun. Yet though the situation Geralt found him in clearly proved Nathaniel was a cruel sadist, it did not prove he was a serial killer. Geralt kept a cool head and decided the priest was not the man he was after.<br>
   1061160|00000000||Before leaving, though, he made sure the degenerate would not hurt poor Nettie any more.<br>
   1061161|00000000||Nevertheless, Geralt still felt Nathaniel deserved death. At times I have thought Geralt too eager to play judge, jury and executioner - but this time, I took no issue with his actions.
   1061162|00000000||Not tarrying any further, Geralt raced off to catch the true perpetrator.

   1054999|00000000||Geralt was not able to establish whose misdeeds had drawn this spirit, but that was not what he was being paid for. With the help of the lighthouse keeper Mikkjal, he defeated the wraith, then went to collect his reward.<br>
   1055001|00000000||It turned out it was the lighthouse keeper, Mikkjal, who was at fault. Working in cahoots with pirates, he would lure ships into the rocks and loot them after they wrecked. These misdeed were what had drawn the phantom. Geralt dealt with situation as he saw fit and then went to collect his reward.<br>
   1054997|00000000||Geralt learned that the village called Arinbjorn was suffering from a wraith problem. The ghost haunted the nearby islet of Eldberg, a barren rock of no interest to anyone save for the lighthouse erected upon it. This lighthouse's light had gone out simultaneously with the phantom's appearance. This meant it had become nigh unto impossible to safely navigate a ship into Arinbjorn harbor after dark. The witcher's task was to chase off the phantom and find out what had happened to the lighthouse keeper.<br>
   1054998|00000000||While traveling across Skellige, Geralt happened upon a rocky isle covered in thick fog, from which came the screaming of wraiths. The witcher was dead set on finding out what was the matter and so bravely rushed towards the wraiths, his silver sword aloft.<br>
   1055000|00000000||It turned out the monster of Eldberg was a Penitent - a dangerous wraith which haunted particularly foul sinners.<br>

   1051833|00000000||While talking to the inhabitants of Larvik, Geralt and Yennefer found out Ciri had been in the village right before the Wild Hunt had descended upon it. She had ridden off with a man called Craven, heading towards Drowned Dead Rock. Geralt and Yennefer decided they had to find this Craven - though both knew there was little chance he would still be alive when they did. The monster dwelling in Freya's garden did not take kindly to visitors.<br>
   1051834|00000000||Geralt, an expert tracker if there ever was one, had little trouble retracing Craven's footsteps. Putting the lie to his insulting nickname, Craven had bravely faced the monster in the garden… and, sad to say, was mortally wounded as a result. Feeling the life seep out of him, Craven found shelter in an underground chamber. That is where he died, and that is where Geralt found his body. This could have marked the end of the trail, and most certainly would have, dear reader, if not for Yennefer's determination...

   1000213|00000000||What's so funny?
    595437|00000000||He's the chief pirate of Faroe, commander of a mighty fleet and a briar in every clan's arse. Though Holger's most of all, as he has to deal with him.

   1077865|00000000||<i>Fled one time in my life. From the Ice Giant. And know what? I'm not a bit ashamed.</i><br>– Rasmund Kvaalkje, Clan Torrdarroch oarsman<br><br>This powerful, primeval monster is quite possibly the last of its race. The Ice Giant resembles a man in many respects, but is blue as frost and taller than a tree. Though it seems capable of reason, all attempts to communicate with it to date have ended in the same way – in a quick and painful death.<br>
   1077864|00000000||It is hard to provide a detailed description of the Ice Giant, for no witcher has ever faced it. It is known only from tales and second-hand reports that mix fact with legend. Skelligers claim its skin is blue because it was born of snow and ice, which is, of course, clearly impossible – though it does indeed seem capable of withstanding the fiercest frosts and in fact seems to draw strength from them. It can bind other creatures to its will, sirens in particular. It treats its victims cruelly and is particularly fond of human flesh. It uses simple weapons made from items looted from the bodies of those it has slaughtered.

   1047943|00000000||Zoltan Chivay has never had much luck in business. No exception to this rule was the time he tried to acquire and sell three valuable gwent cards. At this time gwent was reaching the peak of its popularity and collectors were paying a fool's fortune for rare cards.<br><br>Zoltan was not alone in sticking his pan into this raging torrent and hoping to strike gold. Yet there was another player in Novigrad, one wanting to grow his already-sizeable fortune, interested in flipping rare cards. Duke was his name, but many felt he would soon be known as Whoreson the Third - for he was even more ruthless than Whoreson Junior. This Duke stood in Zoltan's path to riches. Luckily, Zoltan had a friend named Geralt of Rivia who decided to step in and get him the cards he so desperately desired.<br>
   1047944|00000000||The cards were in the possession of Zed - a Novigrad fence. Geralt went to the dealer's house to buy them, but it turned out Duke had made it there before him. A brief exchange quickly turned to blows, and ended with the thugs pushing daisies. Among the splayed-out corpses was that of Zed, whom the murderers had killed earlier.<br><br>Geralt searched the body and discovered his victory was not complete - he only found the Isengrim card. Zed had sold the two remaining ones to Caesar Bilzen and a man named Ravvy. There was nothing left but to visit both purchasers and get Zoltan his cards.<br>
   1047953|00000000||Thanks some clever misdirection by Zoltan, Geralt acquired the card held by Caesar Bilzen. He also managed to get the card from Ravik. I'll spare you the details of that unfortunate incident, during which gushers of blood chased down pitchers of alcohol. Perhaps some future chronicler of the lurid and ghastly will fill you in on them. I will satisfy myself with telling you that, having acquired all three cards, Zoltan and Geralt met with their prospective buyer. This individual, it turned out, lacked something essential for the transaction to be completed - namely, his life. Standing over his stiffening corpse: Duke and his henchmen.<br>
   1047966|00000000||In any game, one must account for the possibility of losing. And in a game as dangerous as that played by Duke against Geralt and Zoltan, losing meant never playing anything ever again.

   1087094|00000000||Though Geralt had promised Zoltan help, he quickly realized he had far more important matters to tend to. This came as a great disappointment to Zoltan, true, but it's hard to blame Geralt for doing as he did: in those days, he truly did have a hearty helping of more urgent problems on his plate. Luckily Zoltan's not the type to bear a grudge, so both of them soon forgot the matter and continued on as fast friends.

Yet none of these foreign trinkets could rival the carved horn passed down to him from his ancestors for his affections.

   1087087|00000000||The residents of White Orchard had suffered more than their fair share of misfortunes. Passing armies had trammeled their spring planting, a griffin had begun abducting their livestock, and, the rotten icing on this painful cake, a noonwraith haunted a nearby well. No wonder the locals called this final evil a 'devil'. The witcher could sense something bound her to this place, and that in order to send her off into the ethereal realms he would first need to learn her secret.<br><br>Once that was done, he would have to prepare for battle - and a noonwraith is a demanding opponent. She can disorient her victim by blinding him and creating mirror images of herself. These copies slowly suck their victim's life energy - while their mistress remains untouchable. In order to defeat her, the witcher could not rely on his silver sword alone - the Yrden sign would also be needed to trap her and force her to take on material form.
   1087088|00000000||<br>Witchers don't normally feel a limited range of emotions regarding the monsters they slay. They despise the particularly cruel ones and are repulsed by the disgusting ones, but rare indeed is the monster for which they feel sympathy. Yet that is exactly what Geralt felt for the noonwraith of White Orchard. For a long time he was haunted by thoughts of the young woman whose horrible death and powerful emotions had transformed her into that terrible monster.

   1051063|00000000||Geralt caught word that the villagers of Fyresdal had caught sight of a dragon. Though the witcher codex barred him from killing these noble and intelligent creatures, he decided to investigate the matter all the same.<br>
   1051064|00000000||His investigation uncovered that what the Fyresdal residents had seen was not a dragon but a forktail - a beast that, while undoubtedly dangerous, has about as much in common with a dragon as do dragonflies. Geralt tracked down the monster's nest (which it had made in an abandoned siege tower), but the forktail itself was nowhere to be found. Geralt decided that, rather than wait for the beast to return, he would lure it back home using bait.<br>
   1051065|00000000||Geralt defeated the monster and returned to collect his reward. Not wanting to take from the villagers their story about the dragon (which had already made them the envy of all the isles) Geralt decided to hide the true identity of the beast he had slain.
   1051908|00000000||Geralt defeated the monster and returned to the village to collect his reward. This turned out to be smaller than first offered - having learned that the beast was no dragon but a much less dangerous forktail, the village elder decided the witcher's honorarium should likewise be proportionately smaller. This was not the first time honesty had lightened the witcher's purse.<br>
   1051909|00000000||The village elder honored Geralt that day with the gift of a lamb - though the animal he gave was certainly not the choicest member of the flock. From what Geralt later told me, the poor creature looked like a furry water hag and had an even worse temperament.<br>

   1053399|00000000||While walking along the shore of the lake near Kaer Morhen, Geralt came across the body of a drowner. The witcher thought at first that Lambert or Eskel had killed the creature - but upon closer inspection he soon discovered there were no marks dealt by sword or Sign. It was thus clear someone - or something - else had done the drowner in. They say the enemy of one's enemy is a friend, but Geralt wanted to see who exactly this drowner-killing "friend" was.<br>
   1053408|00000000||It turned out the drowners had perished at the hands of an old rock troll who clearly did not want them as neighbors. He didn't seem fond of Geralt's presence, either - or at least, it seems safe to conclude as much, given that he tried to tear the witcher to shreds as soon as he saw him. Witchers make tougher opponents than drowners, however, and the troll was soon cut down. Geralt then uncovered a very interesting document in the troll's cave that shed new light on the Salamandra's attack on the fortress years prior.

   1077794|00000000||<i>Most dangerous of all are the royal wyverns. Or, as they're called in some circles, the royal pains in the arse.</i><br>– Albina Tottelkampf, lecturer in natural sciences at Aretuza<br><br>Wyverns are often mistaken for dragons, and, though they are much smaller than their more famous kin and do not breathe fire, they are likewise extremely dangerous monsters. Especially feared are the so-called royal wyverns who, like their namesake monarchs, are exceptionally ornery and extremely deadly.<br>
   1077795|00000000||A wyvern will usually attack from the air, aiming to knock its prey down with its wings. After landing it will attack with its tooth-filled beak, trying to draw attention away from its most dangerous weapon: the stinger found at the end of its long tail. A strike from this carries the risk of poisoning from powerful toxins. Even a witcher's body experiences wrenching pain when injected with wyvern venom, and so it is worth preparing oneself with suitable potions ahead of time.

   1081450|00000000||Your average nekker is cowardly and weak and only ever attacks in groups, even then only when the group greatly outnumbers its opponents. Yet at times there will appear among them an individual who towers over the rest in terms of strength, stamina and cunning. Such nekkers are usually called warriors, though that name is misleading. Warriors fight with honor, face to face. These overgrown nekkers act more like assassins - they strike by surprise, from hiding, in the back, or when their opponent exposes himself while attacking. Luckily, like other nekkers warriors are vulnerable to all the Signs, and their blows can be easily parried or countered.

   1061377|00000000||Geralt and Keira's journey to the elven mage's lair had forged a tight bond between them, the kind harrowing life-or-death experiences forge between soldiers at war or students during exam week. And so when it was all over Keira invited Geralt to stop by her hut sometime, in a way that suggested she did not mean for an afternoon of tea and crumpets.<br>
   1061378|00000000||And indeed she did not - but nor did she mean what you or Geralt surely had in mind. In truth, she had a favor to ask. She wanted Geralt to help her tackle the curse afflicting Fyke Isle.
   1087303|00000000||Though lifting curses is a witcher's bread and butter, this time Geralt abandoned the job before seeing it through to fruition.

   1087304|00000000||The curse was lifted and anyone who wished could now safely visit Fyke Isle  - yet Geralt did not return to Keira to tell her about his success. I don't know why he neglected to do so, but I am confident he had his own, perfectly valid reasons.

   1050859|00000000||Ciri's explosion of power had frightened everyone, her most of all. Clearly these uncontrolled outbursts could not be allowed to happen again, and so when the sorceresses departed for Novigrad to gather the Lodge, Ciri, Geralt and Avallac'h remained at Kaer Morhen for a few more days. The Sage hoped to teach Ciri a few tricks for controlling her power.<br>
   1051244|00000000||Sad to say, in the beginning her training was not progressing as hoped. Ciri had trouble focusing - rage and resignation would overwhelm her in turns. Geralt, the wily old wolf, knew how to deal with this. Instead of hitting her over the head with some dry motivational lecture, he decided to resort to less conventional measures and... started a snowball fight. Pure genius! And what fun! Ah, how I would have loved to have been there... But no matter, the important thing is this moment of carefree respite worked wonders on Ciri - her discouragement slackened and she returned to her training with newfound verve.<br>

   1051249|00000000||We had all long known Emhyr was an ingeniously ice-blooded negotiator, but this time his cold cunning plumbed new depths. While Ciri watched in horror, he offered to pay Geralt a reward for finding her, as though she were a lost goat or a runaway slave. Luckily Geralt, his hair bristling and with a low but thundering growl, told the emperor exactly where he could stick his filthy lucre.<br>

While Ciri watched in horror, he offered to pay Geralt his reward for finding her, as though she were a lost goat or a runaway slave.

   1051247|00000000||Yet Geralt felt they needed to take care of other matters first. He had promised the emperor he would bring Ciri to see him, and intended to keep his word. Ciri and Geralt thus made a detour to Vizima.<br>
   1051254|00000000||Leaving the safety of protective walls behind them, Geralt and Ciri ventured to Bald Mountain to exact their revenge on Imlerith.<br>
   1051976|00000000||The next morning Ciri woke Geralt before dawn. She was wide-awake, a look of intense excitement on her face and urgency in her voice. What had brought her to this state?

    465555|00000000||Hey there! Easy!
   1061137|00000000||Even for Skelligers, who value courage above all else, Vigi's fearlessness went far beyond the pale of bravery, deep into the realm of suicidal madness. This Clan Tordarroch warrior had strived to earn the right to be called Vigi the Unfearing. Instead, his actions earned him the nickname Vigi the Loon - and it seemed this outcome suited him just fine.<br><br>It was Vigi who, craving glory and wanting to save his home isle from the Ice Giant, had convinced Hjalmar to brave the journey to Undvik. Many of their crew were killed during this expedition, and Vigi himself wound up a prisoner in the Ice Giant's cave.<br>
   1061138|00000000||Sadly, that cage became his tomb and sepulcher. When awakened the giant crushed it with one blow, putting an abrupt end to Vigi's lunacy.<br>
   1061139|00000000||The second Geralt freed Vigi from his cage, the Skelliger lived up to his moniker and awoke the sleeping giant with a hearty kick. To be fair, afterwards he fought bravely and effectively against the monster, proving he had the makings of a mighty warrior behind his madness.<br>
   1061140|00000000||That was not the last time Vigi and Geralt fought side by side. Vigi answered Geralt's call and went with Hjalmar to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Though once again he fought with skill and courage, this time he fell in battle.<br><br>News of his heroic death reached Skellige, where in ballads he has earned the title that eluded him in life: Vigi the Unfearing.<br>
   1061136|00000000||Vigi the Loon
   1051071|00000000||Driven by an atavistic need or some other reason beyond my comprehension, Geralt walked into an abandoned mine near the Inn at the Crossroads. Inside he found - and this surely will come as no surprise to you, dear, perceptive reader - monster tracks. He also came across a terrified woman who told him how a beast had devoured a group of men - and that the brother of one of the victims, a man named Bruno, would surely pay the witcher for slaying it.<br>
   1051073|00000000||In my experience, mines either hold precious metals or (more frequently) deadly monsters. The latter, in the form of arachasae, were present in great abundance in the Velen pits. Geralt knew he had to annihilate them for good - meaning he had to kill the female and destroy all the eggs she had lain.<br>
   1051074|00000000||Arachasae are incredibly dangerous beasts, but a witcher is not just some run-of-the-mill adventure seeker. In a bloody battle whose echoes could be heard throughout all of Velen, Geralt killed the old arachas queen and put an end to her vile line.
   1051913|00000000||Though Geralt had plenty of other worries, he had not forgotten about his trade - which is, let I remind you, slaying monsters. While striving to practice his profession he came across a contract offering an altogether attractive sum in return for tracking down a certain missing individual. No mention of monsters, true, but Geralt had seen enough incidents of its like to suspect one might turn up - and besides, when it comes down to it, coin is coin...<br>

   1053033|00000000||While visiting an accountant by the name of Caesar Bilzen, Geralt snitched a soldier figurine from his host's collection. While I usually deplore such acts of petty larceny as bad manners to say the least, this time it led to quite the interesting series of events, so I am prepared to let it slide. The statuette, you see, emanated magic and our witcher sensed it might be tied to something of prime importance, so he decided to show it to Triss.<br>
   1053034|00000000||The witcher's premonition was... well, if not exactly right, still worth having followed. Triss cast a decompression spell on the figurine and it transformed into a living, breathing human. To be precise, it turned into a Nilfgaardian soldier whom the sorceress Coral had transfigured in the midst of a battle many years ago. Nothing of prime importance per se, but quite interesting nonetheless.

    397245|00000000||<i>Nightwraiths exude this immense sadness, this helpless wrath… I fear them, same as anyone. But most of all I feel sorry for them.</i><br>– Aelline Altsparr, elven trobairitz. <br><br>Compared to other creatures of the night – katakans, nekurats and werewolves, for example – nightwraiths (and their rarer cousins, duskwraiths) might not seem all that dangerous. After all, one might ask, how much harm could a pale, withered woman in a tattered dress do? The answer: quite a bit. Instead of finding this out the hard way, avoid crossing fields and meadows at night at all costs.<br>
   1077804|00000000||Like noonwraiths, nightwraiths are only found in rural areas. Travelers fall victim to them most often, but if legends are to be believed they also sneak into huts at times and murder peasants in their sleep. <br><br>When they attack nightwraiths remain immaterial for most of the time, meaning physical blows pass right through them. They only take on more tangible form for the brief moments in which they strike. When weakened, they will create several projections of themselves which cannot attack directly but act as transmitters of sorts through which the nightwraith can sap her victim's vital energy. <br><br>Nightwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force one to take on corporeal form, trap it with the Yrden Sign or hit it with the blast of a Moon Dust bomb.<br><br>Do not believe the old wife tales and think yourself completely safe from nightwraiths during the day. They appear under the light of the sun as well - but are much weaker then than after dusk.

   1051923|00000000||North of the Nilfgaardian camp Geralt came across tracks left by a large beast. He decided to check where, and most importantly to whom, they would lead him.<br>
   1051924|00000000||Geralt found the refugees in a cave where they had sought shelter from a monster. Such is the fate of refugees all too often - they are forever jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. They told the witcher about the beast that had attacked them during their travels and asked him for help.<br>
   1051086|00000000||It didn't take much for an old hand like Geralt to find out that the monster which had attacked the refugees was a wyvern. And not just any wyvern - a royal wyvern, though I doubt knowing they had come in close contact with royalty was much comfort to them.<br>
   1051093|00000000||After taking care of the beast prowling the roadside and saving the missing refugees, Geralt collected his reward from their worried comrades.
   1051922|00000000||Once upon a time, Geralt took a contract from a group of refugees. I don't know if he felt sorry for the poor souls or if his witcher blood was simply itching for some action - one way or the other, he promised to find their missing companions, who had set off with a caravan headed north. All signs seemed to indicate a beast had attacked them en route.<br>

   1078419|00000000||During the war that pitted the Northern Realms against Nilfgaard, the border along the Pontar river was closed. Whoever wanted to cross at the border posts had to show a pass issued by the Redanian high command. Or, barring that, one of the convincing counterfeits sold by the shady Redanian who hung about near the river crossings.<br>
   1078420|00000000||The false papers proved as good as real ones. Once Geralt had acquired them, he could cross the border at will.
   1086982|00000000||The counterfeiter made Geralt an offer he couldn't refuse: a falsified pass in exchange for helping the man's brother. Geralt eagerly agreed to the exchange, but didn't hold up his end of the bargain. The counterfeiter's brother died, and Geralt had to find another way of securing transit papers.

Then this cockatrice sprung up nearby, and now all's I got left's dried patties in an empty field.</i><br>– Jethro, peasant from Pindal<br><br>Foolish superstitions claim cockatrices, like basilisks, can kill with their gaze alone. That is utter nonsense, however, a cockatrice's gaze being no more dangerous than that of an angry goose. One should instead watch out for its sharp beak and long tail, which it can whip to murderous effect.<br>
   1077782|00000000||Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements. Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor.<br><br>Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wing and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. Blows from their beaks are especially dangerous, as they aim with deadly precision at exposed flesh and vital organs and leave bleeding, life-threatening wounds. When fighting them one should make liberal use of draconid oil as well as Grapeshot, whose shrapnel will pierce their delicate wings with ease.

    571656|00000000||Oxenfurt the academy may be my alma mater, but Oxenfurt the town - that is where I received my true education. The experiences I had in its inns and alleyways often left me a trembling wreck, overwhelmed by the majesty of the world opening up before me. Sadly, during the Third Nilfgaardian War the town became a shadow of its former self, and the few who remained in its inns and alleyways risked not enlightenment but death at the hands of a mysterious murderer. Geralt, bless his heart, decided to investigate the matter, suspecting that the responsible party might be a monster...<br>
   1051967|00000000||Geralt had dealt with a great variety of beasts over the course of his career as a witcher, but an alcoholic vampire...? That was a first (well, except for maybe that one - but that was long ago). This katakan (as witchers call this manner of beast) had taken a liking to the blood of drunk men. Once Geralt figured this out, he knew exactly how to lure it out of hiding.<br>
   1051968|00000000||Geralt fought the katakan, but sadly the beast fled the first chance it got. Vampires never do make for easy foes. Geralt decided to use his Witcher Senses to hunt the monster down.<br>
   1051969|00000000||At last, success was his! Geralt tracked down and killed the katakan. The Redanian soldiers who had hired him kept their word and paid him appropriately for a job well done.

    472943|00000000||An old woman in Velen asked Geralt for an unusual favor. Some time ago her hens had gone missing from her hen house.

   1051211|00000000||Geralt discovered the chicken thief was not a monster but a group of war orphans. Their parents caught and killed by passing soldiers, the children had been forced to fend for themselves - and Geralt was forced to choose what to do with them.<br>
   1051212|00000000||Geralt returned to the old woman who had asked him to investigate her missing poultry. He told her about the group of children he had encountered in the woods.

Corinne was one of the best of her kind and had no trouble finding clients, even with the hostility to the occult that reigned in Novigrad at the time. Geralt hoped she would spare him a few moments, and set off to find her in a house where she had gone to ply her trade.<br>
   1002007|00000000||Corinne agreed to help Geralt and put together a dreaming séance for him. Geralt has always been an introvert, and talking about his feelings and loved ones does not come easy for him. Yet that was exactly what the dreamer needed him to do if she was to dream about Ciri.

   1083607|00000000||Eredin's last words, however, proved a lie. Avallac’h had not abducted Ciri, he was her mentor.

   1072891|00000000||As commander of Temerian special forces - an elite squadron known as the "Blue Stripes" - Vernon Roche had been one of King Foltest's most trusted subordinates. Time and time again Roche proved himself loyal, effective and a thoroughgoing professional. Few could match his skill at putting down rebellions, fighting of Nilfgaardians or snuffing out bands of Scoia'tael.<br><br>At our story's start, however, he had been deprived of his king, his men and his homeland, and so had resorted to conducting guerilla warfare against the overwhelmingly more powerful occupying forces.<br>
   1072892|00000000||Roche's guerrilla war was dependent on Redanian help, though it was clear he took no pleasure from working with Radovid.<br>
   1072893|00000000||Some time later it was revealed that Vernon had joined a conspiracy to assassinate Radovid. He had realized that, once the war was however, this mad king would snuff any hopes for a free Temeria, making Roche himself a liability and potential foe.<br>
   1072894|00000000||Vernon took personal part in the assassination. The king of Redania's death was to be a guarantee of Temerian independence. In order to achieve this, Roche was not afraid to strike a deal with the Nilfgaardians. This move played right into Dijkstra's hand.<br><br>Geralt, refusing to get involved in their conflict, left them to work it out for themselves. As a result, Roche died at Dijkstra's orders.<br>

   1050850|00000000||Geralt and Ciri had no choice but to teleport away from the Isle of Mists when the Wild Hunt threatened to attack. Since Eredin could trace where Ciri traveled to with her abilities, the duo did not so much flee the Hunt as buy a few precious minutes of time. Ciri took Geralt home, to Kaer Morhen, where the group of friends the witcher had gathered waited to defend Ciri to their last breath. They spared a few seconds for a tearful reunion - then began preparations to repel the Hunt's attack.<br>
   1050851|00000000||The friends conferred and established a defense strategy. There was no time to lose. As soon as they finished, the weather changed and snow began to fall. The Wild Hunt appeared above Kaer Morhen and its spectral warriors galloped out of the sky towards the fortress.<br>
   1050854|00000000||The defenders of Kaer Morhen did what they could to hold back their attackers, but the enemy's strength was overwhelming. The Wild Hunt had made it to the very walls of Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1050855|00000000||Warrior after warrior fell to our heroes' blows, but others immediately took their place. The defenders fell back beyond the inner gates of the fortress - and so began the last phase of the battle.<br>
   1050856|00000000||It was a dark hour for the defenders of Kaer Morhen. The generals of the Hunt had entered the fray personally. Vesemir had died by Imlerith's hand, and it seemed all of the witcher's friends would soon share his fate. The defenders' lives were hanging by a thread, when suddenly Ciri's magic talent revealed its full force. In an uncontrolled outburst of rage she pummeled both allies and enemies alike with a blast of pure Power. The Hunt's forces were nearly wiped out, leaving them no choice but to retreat. Only our valiant defenders, exhausted, wounded, but still alive, remained on the field of battle.<br>
   1050857|00000000||The Battle of Kaer Morhen was over. Those who survived buried Vesemir, but had little time for mourning. The danger had only been thwarted temporarily, and they needed to prepare a new plan for saving Ciri.

   1077418|00000000||Dear Elke,<br><br>Thank the gods fools believe in them! We've made good use of that fact twice now. Firstly, when we stole that load of silver from the temple. No one was watching it - because who would be brave enough to risk the gods' wrath by desecrating such a holy place? And then we hid it all in ruins said to have been cursed by the elven gods. No one goes near there, no one even looks at them too closely - so we didn't even really have to hide it, as treasure's safer there than in the Vivaldi Bank.<br><br>We'll spend the night in the woods, then I'll ride to Novigrad, find a buyer for the whole stash. We're going to be rich, Elke, rich! And maybe then I'll throw something in the plate, a token of my gratitude to superstition and stupidity!<br><br>-Your Edgar<br>
   1077419|00000000||To this day we still don't know exactly what happened. All that is certain is neither Edgar nor Elke ever came to collect the treasure hidden in the elven ruins. A druid friend of mine to whom I told this story claimed that they must have met with divine punishment. I hope Geralt avoids a similar fate, for he helped himself to the valuables the blasphemers had gathered.
   1087009|00000000||Elven ruins are as dangerous as they are beautiful. Clear proof of this fact was given by the bodies Geralt found while exploring just such a set of decaying monuments in Velen. One of the corpses was carrying a set of notes. Intrigued, Geralt unfurled the parchment and began to read...

    552347|00000000||A Nilfgaardian patrol had gone missing near the village of Byways. Geralt took an interest in the matter, for the local Nilfgaardian commander suspected a monster was involved and Geralt knew imperial soldiers were always upfront and honest when it came to pay.<br>
   1051079|00000000||Geralt discovered that local villagers had decided to make a few extra crowns by digging in an ancient elven mine. Since the old underground complex hid its fair share of unpleasant surprises, it wasn't long before they ran into trouble. <br><br>The self-taught treasure hunters had awakened a particularly nasty kind of vampire known as an ekimmara, and this enraged beast had attacked the Nilfgaardian patrol as it passed through Byways. Geralt decided to eradicate the beast and tracked it to the ruins outside the village.<br>
   1051080|00000000||The Nilfgaardian soldiers proved themselves honorable men and paid the witcher without a murmur, handing him not only what he was owed for killing the ekimmara, but also a reward for having discovered the truth of what had happened to their missing patrol.<br>
   1051915|00000000||Geralt told the Nilfgaardian commander what had happened to the missing patrol and received his reward. The commander brought no dishonor to his uniform and paid in full, without haggling or backpedalling.<br>
   1051920|00000000||When the ekimmara had been defeated, the villagers of Byways did not prove very grateful. With long years of witchering experience under his belt, Geralt did not find this very surprising.<br>
   1051921|00000000||The villagers were grateful to the witcher for his help in slaying the ekimmara, so much so they even agreed to pay Geralt a reward.<br>
   1082243|00000000||While traveling across Velen, Geralt happened across a village which seemed to have been abandoned. The ghouls lurking amidst the huts gave him a bad feeling about its former inhabitants' fate, so the witcher decided to kill the monsters and investigate what had happened.<br>

   1089396|00000000||Gwent is an ancient dwarven card game that simulates the <<Color_Gwint>>clash of two armies<<End_Color>> in battle. The players are <<Color_Gwint>>generals<<End_Color>>, and the cards are their <<Color_Gwint>>forces<<End_Color>>.
    592837|00000000||Something about life in dreary backwoods settlements leads their inhabitants to hide the truth with misleading names. This takes the form of both hyperbole - a clump of bare trees called "Dragon Spike Forest" or a hole in the ground two paces deep named "The Chasm of Eternity" - and understatement - a horrid massacre calmly referred to as "the incident." Velen fit the mold in this regard, as Geralt learned while he wandered through it in search of Ciri. There he encountered a trio of highly suspicious magical sisters called the Ladies of the Wood, who directed him to a clump of bogside huts known as Downwarren. Geralt was to solve their "problem": a rash of mysterious murders. He spoke to the ealdorman and learned that the evil power behind the killings dwelled in the Whispering Hillock. Wherever else?<br>
    592838|00000000||The truth hidden under the Whispering Hillock? A woman's spirit, imprisoned in a cave within it. Geralt felt sympathy for the ill-treated ghost and helped it enter the body of a horse, thus regaining its freedom.<br>
    592839|00000000||The truth hidden under the Whispering Hillock? A woman's spirit, imprisoned in a cave within it. Geralt concluded this foul being was responsible for murdering the inhabitants of Downwarren, and so destroyed its heart, loosening its last grasp on our world.<br>
   1077528|00000000||While roaming the thick, gloomy tangles of the Velen woodlands, Geralt came across a spirit whose heart was trapped in a cave under an eye-catching tree…<br>

   1051248|00000000||In the backwoods of Velen Geralt came across an altar, and next to it - two troubled villagers. When asked the source of their worries, the peasants told Geralt the deity they worshipped - the awe-inspiring Allgod - had rejected the offerings they had brought him. The witcher was not a particularly gods-fearing individual, yet nevertheless promised that he'd intercede for the peasants with their deity.<br>
   1051251|00000000||It turned out the revered Allgod was a run-of-the-mill sylvan, or, as the common folk call these beings, a deovel. The conniving beast had convinced the local peasantry of its divine powers and had grown fat on their offerings for decades.<br>
   1051252|00000000||To Geralt's thinking, while the sylvan had not killed or even injured anyone, it was still a harmful parasite and thus deserved death. The witcher expected the peasants to thank him for freeing them from this horned huckster - but his rational approach to matters of faith met with incomprehension and horror.<br>
   1051253|00000000||Geralt convinced the sylvan demanding outrageously sumptuous offerings in a time of poverty and famine was immoral and unbecoming, even for a false god. The sylvan seemed skeptical at first, but after eyeing the silver sword on Geralt's back he decided he'd best not argue.<br>
   1051255|00000000||The witcher's argument that demanding outrageously sumptuous offerings in a time of poverty and famine was immoral and unbecoming of even a false god did not convince the sylvan. Geralt decided he was not going to toss his pearls before this particular swine anymore and bid the Allgod farewell before continuing on his path.<br>

    492511|00000000||I would wager anyone that you, dear reader, are a person of culture and taste – and therefore already familiar with me, Dandelion, and the role I am to play in the following tale. Nevertheless, allow me to sketch a few lines by way of self-portrait, for the sake of thoroughness, and in the event you have spent much of the last half-century in some dark corner where the light of my star has yet to reach.<br><br>"Born in 1229, a talented poet and troubadour, a graduate of Oxenfurt Academy, a frequent performer at royal courts, an unequaled lover appreciated, and in some cases adored, by ladies worldwide, a skilled negotiator and a stirring orator" – such is the image of the bard Dandelion as painted by his friends and promoters.<br><br>This image is, of course, somewhat overbright in its coloring – I personally prefer to think of myself as a dedicated artist in thrall to his Muse, one whose work has benefited immeasurably from the fact that I was, am and forever will remain a close friend and steadfast companion to the witcher Geralt. It is his fate I chronicle in this present work and his story which I shall sing till the end of my days.<br>
    492594|00000000||Having learned of my disappearance, Geralt dropped everything to find out what had become of me. Though at first he suspected the cause of my trouble lay in my many and turbulent affairs of the heart, he later determined that I had strayed into a life of crime, seeking to steal treasure belonging to one of the leaders of Novigrad's underworld.<br>
   1060546|00000000||The motivations for my actions only became clear some time later. I proved that, when it comes to helping Cirilla, I would not balk at sticking my head into the lion's maw, let alone crossing such common scum as Cyprian Wiley, better known (for good reason!) as Whoreson.<br>
   1060547|00000000||Only a madman calls it courage to fight when faced with overwhelming odds. Though known for my capricious and unpredictable charm, I am not yet considered mad, and so, while defending my companion's escape to the very last, I ultimately allowed the temple guard to take me to their prison, where I awaited my imminent execution.<br>
   1060548|00000000||The saying does not lie - "true friends show when fortune hides her face." My dear comrades gave ample evidence of this by breaking me free from my prison transport, saving me from certain and painful death.<br>

   1054362|f292d400||Var Attre Guard Captain
   1062504|00000000||The witcher first met the raven-haired sorceress a good twenty years back. Their friendship and the feelings between them were born of a common adventure involving a genie and a wish granted to Geralt that intertwined their fates inextricably.<br><br>In the time since then their relationship had, however, been quite stormy - rich in ups and downs, crises and break-ups. Geralt and Yennefer’s love provides irrefutable proof of the thesis that "opposites attract." <br><br>A few years ago Geralt and Yennefer had, after a long separation full of adventures for them both, gotten back together again. Their moment of repose was interrupted by the Wild Hunt, which took Yennefer captive. The witcher set out at once to save her, but lost his memory while doing so. When he finally recovered it, he immediately set off once more on his quest to find his beloved sorceress.<br>
   1062505|00000000||The circumstances of Geralt’s initial reunion with Yennefer after two years were quite different than he had imagined. The sorceress was not only safe and sound, but had even secured the aid of an unexpected and might ally - the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br>
   1062506|00000000||Geralt's relationship with Triss during Yennefer's absence had clearly cast a cloud over their reunion. If the witcher wanted to win back his one-time love, he would need to take bolder steps than relying on his memory loss as an excuse - one which, while valid, did little to repair the damage.<br>
   1062507|00000000||A thick air of repressed hostility reigned during Geralt’s time with Yennefer in Skellige. More than once the sorceress sharply expressed her displeasure, sparing no cutting remark - just like during the best years of their relationship. In the end, however, the witcher's patience was rewarded, and their expedition to retrieve the mask of Uroboros brought the former lovers back together.<br><br>The gulf that had arisen between them during their time of separation seemed that much narrower.<br>
   1062510|00000000||In order to obtain the information they needed Yennefer did not hesitate to resort to necromancy, and destroyed the goddess Freya's garden while doing so. If the proud sorceress felt any guilt as a result, as usual she showed no sign of it.<br>
   1062511|00000000||The idea of hunting another genie together did not at first arouse Geralt's enthusiasm, but Yennefer had a truly valid reason for wanting it. If she succeeded in forcing the genie to take back the wish binding her to the witcher, she would finally know if the feelings between them were truly love or merely magic.<br>
   1062512|00000000||The genie granted Yennefer's request and broke the thread of destiny binding her to Geralt. Luckily it turned out their love could continue - without the need for supernatural assistance.<br>
   1062513|00000000||The genie granted Yennefer's request and that special magic between Geralt and Yennefer disappeared forever, leaving behind only regret, emptiness and a feeling of loss. Sadly, it is true what they say: "be careful what you wish for."<br>
   1062516|00000000||Though the sorceress' difficult character had made life miserable for everyone at Kaer Morhen, in the end it was her stubborn determination that led to Uma's disenchantment and the lifting of Avallac'h's curse.<br>
   1062518|00000000||Yennefer had always felt some ends justified otherwise unsavory means. When it became clear rescuing Ciri would require the help of Philippa Eilhart and the other sorceresses of the reviled Lodge, she forgot about any bad blood and convinced Emhyr to grant them amnesty.<br>
   1062520|00000000||One need not be particular skilled in reading human character to have guessed that toying with Yennefer's feelings would bring retribution. Likewise even Geralt should have known that his attempts to keep a foot in both camps with her and Triss would end badly for him. Considering the raven-haired sorceress' explosive temperament, the humiliating punishment he met was unusually lenient.<br>

    397244|00000000||<i>An alghoul's basically a badarse ghoul</i><br>– Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior<br><br>Alghouls differ from normal ghouls in size, strength, coloring and, most importantly, intelligence. Whereas ghouls and graveirs are primitive creatures unfit to plan even the simplest ambush, alghouls and their kindred (such as cemetaurs) are capable of forethought, and are thus much more dangerous.<br>
   1077291|00000000||Ghouls seem to possess wits enough to at least know a brighter mind when they see it, and so let alghouls and cemetaurs lead their packs. A pack so led will terrorize all in its path, attacking not only lone travelers but also caravans and even farmsteads. When encountering such a pack the alghoul should be eliminated as a first priority, leaving the other beasts for once their leader is gone. One be particularly careful when fighting alghouls around dusk and at night, when they fight with doubled strength.<br><br>During combat alghouls and cemetaurs try risky maneuvers aimed at knocking their opponents to the ground so the others can finish the job by tearing them to shreds. Like a normal ghoul, an injured alghoul can fall into a frenzy and attack with blind fury. An experienced witcher knows to get out of its way on such occasions and strike from behind, while for an inexperienced witcher, such a turn of events often marks the end of his Path.

   1051957|00000000||The clues Geralt found led him to a house of ill-repute. As is often the case in such establishments, more than lovemaking was taking place within its walls...<br>
   1051958|00000000||Geralt's investigation revealed a succubus had been responsible for the city guardsmen's murder. I've dealt with more than one such creature in my life and I must say, if anyone is under the misconception that encounters with these creatures are pleasant - well, I would disabuse him of it myself, but I know that is a task only unfortunate experience can accomplish. Suffice it to say death from a surfeit of pleasure leaves one no less dead.<br>
   1051959|00000000||After talking to the succubus, Geralt decided to spare its life. When he told me this, I was at first outraged, but then he explained the arguments the succubus had given him and convinced me the guards she had killed had earned their fate.<br>
   1051960|00000000||Geralt tracked down the succubus. They had a brief conversation, during which the succubus tried to justify herself by providing motives for her murders. Geralt remained unmoved and the succubus met with due punishment for her crimes.<br>

   1053409|00000000||An observation tower located on a hillside near Kaer Morhen caught Geralt's eye. Though the structure had been there for as long as he could remember, this was the first time in ages he had bothered to inspect it more closely. When he did, he discovered a whole heap of wraiths had taken up residence within. I've said it before and I'll say it again - witchers make horrible housekeepers.<br>
   1053410|00000000||Geralt was able to deduce from the evidence at hand that the fortress was haunted by the ghost of a boy who had once trained to be a witcher. His monster slaying career had been tragically nipped in the bud when enraged fanatics attacked Kaer Morhen. <br><br>Geralt found and buried the poor lad's remains, and along with them two swords, one of silver, the other of steel. He hoped this would give the boy's tortured soul some peace and allow him to depart from the old bastion.

   1027732|00000000||Found some of Berengar's notes. From what I made out, he was trying to forge a sword - Tor'haerne. You were helping him.
   1027733|00000000||Advising, at best… Boy never managed to forge the blade, but would never let me at the anvil. Just pestered me with questions. Wanted to do it all by himself, as always. But then the whole plan went to the devil. Literally!
   1027734|00000000||What do you mean?
   1027735|00000000||Berengar set out to hunt a chort. Fiend had made its lair in the valley past the keep. Don't know why, but he took all his equipment with him… Maybe thought I'd tinker with the sword while he was gone? You know what he was like.
   1043847|00000000||At any rate, the chort turned out to be strong. Too strong. Berengar had to turn tail. And since it's hard to run with four stones of kit under your arm, he dropped it all. Came back red with blood… and shame. Hardly said a word, and left soon after. Never to return.
   1027736|00000000||I know the rest of the story… How do I get to this chort's lair?
   1027737|00000000||Knew you'd want to finish this… Easiest way's to take the river downstream as far as you can go. But be careful. Berengar had his flaws, but he was a damn good fighter. If that chort's still there, you could be in for a wild ride.

   1075988|00000000||If I had reported that any had fled, I would have had to pursue them. I've neither the time nor the resources. So I wrote that all are dead. Unlikely any survived long in the swamp.

   1061620|00000000||As a poet and a romantic, I have immortalized in flowery verse the charms both corporeal and spiritual of many women. Yet when I open my mouth to sing the praises of Priscilla, I find - hard as this might be to conceive - that my throat constricts, words turn to meal in my mouth, and all elaborate turns of speech seem artificial and empty when compared to the natural beauty, talent, sensitivity and intellect nature has bestowed her.<br><br>Priscilla (or Callonetta, the stage name under which she gained artistic renown) was, around the time of our story's beginning, enjoying the last stop on a triumphal tour of concerts that had taken her from the sumptuous courts of Lan Exeter and Pont Vanis, through Tretogor and Caelf, finally bringing her to the glorious city of Novigrad.<br>
   1061621|00000000||Once he had found my Callonetta, Geralt had an opportunity to witness first-hand her beauty and numerous talents - for it was her fertile mind that birthed the play which then ingeniously lured out our elusive doppler friend, Dudu.<br>
   1061622|00000000||News that Priscilla had fallen victim to a brutal attack hit me like a landslide of avalanches. Why someone would possibly want to harm such an innocent creature was a complete mystery to me.<br>
   1061623|00000000||Priscilla had been horribly wounded and her life hung by a thread. Whoever had done this to her did not deserve to live on this earth a moment longer.<br>
   1061625|00000000||In a miracle of skill and learning, the brilliant surgeon Joachim von Gratz was able to save Priscilla and set her on the long, hard road to recovery.<br><br>I have faith that, with the proper medical attention, she will one day regain every beautiful texture to her voice and her song will once more ring out from the Yaruga to the Blue Mountains.

   1060725|00000000||The saying "like father, like son" fits Crach and his first born son to a tittle. Young Hjalmar took after his father in both posture and character, and many predicted that in time he would overtake his elder in the honor and fame he would gain.<br><br>An extremely able, broad-shouldered swordsman, he had the makings of a superb warrior, and his charisma and tendency towards almost mad bravura meant he could stir the hearts of loot- and glory-craving youth from all Skellige's clans.<br>
   1060726|00000000||All these traits made Hjalmar an obvious choice for the next king of Skellige. He thus did not hesitate to stake his claim when the time for this arrived and immediately set off for Undvik to prove his heroism by battling the legendary Ice Giant.<br>
   1060727|00000000||Hjalmar accomplished what he set out to do. Fighting side by side with the witcher he defeated the fierce colossus of Undvik.<br>
   1060728|00000000||Though his sister was chosen to be ruler instead of him, Hjalmar did not bear a grudge and decided to lend her reign all his strength, an act that showed surprising political maturity.<br>
   1060729|00000000||Young an Craite proved his valor when he and the witcher avenged the guests murdered during the infamous "Bloody Banquet" at Kaer Trolde. By this deed he also cleared his family name of all dishonor.<br>
   1060730|00000000||All these feats convinced Skelligers that Hjalmar was fit to be king. Though it was clear it would take some time before the young ruler could step entirely out of his father's shadow, most islanders were pleased and proud with their choice of ruler.<br>
   1060732|00000000||When discussing Hjalmar's heroic deeds it surely must be mentioned that he did not hesitate to support Geralt by answering his call and defending Ciri at Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1060733|00000000||Hjalmar's hot temper turned out to be his doom in the end. Young an Craite died alongside his sister while leading one of the first attacks on the Nilfgaardian fleet.<br>

   1081343|00000000||Most grave hags rarely attack humans, preferring instead to feed on the rotten remains they dig out of graves. Yet some individuals grow bold over the years and begin sneaking into huts to steal children and kill the elderly. Just such a monster was tormenting the inhabitants of Lindenvale.<br><br>The witcher knew this grave hag would put up a fierce fight. He would have to watch out for her powerful claws, capable of smashing through any block or parry, and her long, venomous tongue. He also realized her attacks would be so quick not even his mutated reflexes would be able to keep pace - meaning only judicious use of the Yrden Sign would all him to survive and conquer.

   1086192|00000000||Witchers must be prepared to fight foes of all kinds, be they plate-clad knights, ethereal wraiths or bone-crushing giants. To match the strengths and exploit the weaknesses of different enemies, witchers need to use a variety of weapons and combat techniques.<br><br>The core tools of their trade are their <font color="#CD7D03">swords</font> - one steel, for fighting humans and nonhumans, the other silver, for slaying monsters.<br><br>Witchers have also mastered a simple form of combat magic. These <font color="#CD7D03">Signs</font> are not as powerful as the spells wielded by mages, but they can be cast very quickly - with simple, one-handed gestures - making them quite useful in the heat of combat.<br><br>Witchers are also adept in basic <font color="#CD7D03">alchemy</font>. They can brew powerful potions, blade oils, and bombs - all of which give them a keen advantage when fighting stronger or faster foes.

   1050852|00000000||When Geralt entered the Novigrad bathhouse, he discovered a meeting of the heads of the city's criminal underworld was in progress. He became an unwitting participant in their conversation, during which he learned of the conflict between the triumvirate made up of the King of Beggars, Sigi Reuven and Carlo "Cleaver" Varese against Whoreson Junior and the unknown powers backing him. Cleaver in particular wanted Whoreson gone and offered Geralt the help of his men in taking the bastard out, suiting Geralt's best interests. Since they say many hands make light work and Geralt had every reason to think this applied to gang warfare as much as it did to cleaning a barn, he accepted the gangster's offer.<br>
   1050853|00000000||Geralt did not find Whoreson during his search with Cleaver's men, but do not think his time was wasted. The witcher smashed his way through a fair number of public mingling spaces and slaughtered a great many armed men of diverse social backgrounds, gaining in the doing a unique look at the complications of daily life in the Novigrad underworld. Enriched with this knowledge, Geralt continued his search for Whoreson alone.

   1051292|00000000||Yennefer asked - or rather, if I am to be completely honest with you, dear reader, ordered - Geralt to help Eskel hunt a forktail. The sorceress needed ingredients from this dangerous beast's body and clearly thought two witchers would get the job done sooner than one. Geralt thus set out to track the monster - but first, he had to find Eskel.<br>
   1051293|00000000||In the end, the hunters bagged their prey. Using their traditional and, while we're being honest, rather unrefined methods, the two witchers first lured the forktail close, then wounded the beast and gave chase as it fled, finally finishing it off in its lair. And so they acquired the ingredients Yennefer needed and, no less important, had a bit of time to catch up - Eskel and Geralt had not seen each other in years.

We didn't breathe a word of this to anyone, of course, for the change was decidedly in everyone's best interest. The doppler was a reasonable man deprived of the true Chappelle's cruelty, and under his watch life in town had much improved.<br><br>Sadly, the chancellor's conciliatory style must have raised suspicions given the wave of terror and persecution welling up in Novigrad.

   1049711|00000000||Finding Ciri in Velen had proven harder than tracking a swallow on a rainy day. According to Keira, an elven mage had been tracking this particular swallow as well. Had he found her? Did he know more about her fate? Geralt knew he had to find out, and Keira, well, she had unfinished business of her own with the mage. And so the witcher and sorceress set out together on a journey into the darkness to find the mysterious elf's underground hideout.<br>
   1049712|00000000||Barely had our heroes entered the underground chambers when they encountered the enemy. The Wild Hunt had reached the spot before them - and they, too, were searching for Ciri.<br>
   1049713|00000000||The Hunt had in its ranks a navigator, a powerful mage able to teleport its warriors from place to place in the blink of an eye. Geralt and Keira, on the other hand, made their way slowly on foot, encountering obstacle after obstacle. All might have been lost had our heroes not happened across a morphotic projection the elven mage had left for Ciri. The mage's illusion guided her towards his lair and called her "Zireael" - meaning "swallow" in Elder Speech. Hearing this, Geralt gained two vital clues: the mage clearly knew Ciri well, and he must have painted the swallows on the walls to direct her.<br>
   1049714|00000000||The road through the underground was not an easy one to travel. The mage had set a great many traps that Ciri could easily evade but which would trip up any who chased after her.<br>
   1049715|00000000||In the end Geralt and Keira eliminated the Wild Hunt's lead and began nipping at its heels.<br>
   1049716|00000000||Ciri's pursuers did not find what they were looking for. They departed empty handed, leaving one warrior behind to tend to Geralt and Keira. He proved a weak match for the witcher and the sorceress, but their victory was bittersweet, as in the underground passageways Geralt found neither Ciri nor the elven mage. All he could now do was to follow the hints provided by yet another morphotic projection the mage had left behind.
   1049717|00000000||Geralt finally learned the truth about Ciri and the witch from the mouth of an illusion. The mage's projection corrected and supplemented the information left behind by Hendrik - Ciri's opponent had not been one ordinary witch but the three Crones, mysterious and powerful beings dwelling in Crookback Bog. Who they truly were and what had happened to Ciri at their swampy home - that, dear reader, you will learn in the pages that follow.

   1086964|00000000||<br> This vengeful wraith might very well have killed every last inhabitant of the village, had not a famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia, appeared in Velen - and been in need of a bit of coin.
   1087370|00000000||<i>So... That's to mean... our Zula's the wraith?</i><br>– Bolko, ealdorman of Midcopse<br>
   1081319|00000000||It is said true love's flame is never extinguished. This sad truth is the reason why Zula of Midcopse, whom an early death had separated from her beloved, was unable to find peace in the next life, and instead returned to haunt her former environs as a nightwraith.<br><br>Fighting such an apparition is extremely difficult. A nightwraith will form mirror images of herself to confuse her opponent and aid her in battle. She herself can take on immaterial form, rendering her invulnerable to blows. The best way to force her out of this state is to set a trap with the Yrden Sign, then quickly follow up with Igni while she is caught. Most important of all, however, is this: never attempt to fight one in the middle of the night, when the moon hangs high in the sky.

   1060995|00000000||It is my humble opinion that the most one can learn from staring at the innards of a gutted animal is whether the poor beast was infested with parasites. Nevertheless, Hjort, like many other druids of Skellige, placed a great deal of trust in both haruspicy and chiromancy (and oneiromancy as well, though that's more understandable, dreams being the royal route to one's soul).<br><br>Word was that he commanded a great deal of respect and esteem amongst his fellow practitioners, having more than once accurately prophesied the future and interpreted the meaning of obtuse dreams. This druid was devoted to Clan Brokvar with all his heart, and his knowledge and ability made him an excellent advisor, one in whom the jarl of Spikeroog, Udalryk of Clan Brokvar, placed a great deal of trust.<br>

   1059050|00000000||Oneiromancy, the magic art of deciphering the past and the future as they appear in dreams, is difficult for even a highly trained sorceress to master.

   1050766|00000000||The commander of the Nilfgaardian garrison in White Orchard knew where Yennefer had gone. Shrewdly, he was unwilling to share this information for free. A man with substantial experience, he knew full well Geralt would do anything to find the sorceress. As luck would have it, there was a griffin about, a beast the commander's soldiers had been unable to hunt down. The commander could demand but one thing: the monster's head in exchange for his help.<br>
   1050767|00000000||The witcher investigated and learned that the griffin he had encountered along the high road outside of White Orchard had good reason to prey on the local populace. The soldiers the Nilfgaardian commander had sent out to scout had, in fact, killed the griffin's brooding mate. Griffins are known to mate for life, and Geralt thus felt a pang of pity for the beast. But, ever the professional, he could not let his feelings interfere with his work.<br>
   1050771|00000000||Once it came to ambushing the feathery widower, Geralt turned to Vesemir for help. With two witchers lunging at its throat, the griffin of White Orchard proved a lamb for the slaughter. As is the way of his order, Geralt took the beast's head as his trophy and delivered it to the Nilfgaardian garrison for his reward, which, as you might remember, was to be information about Yennefer.

   1050992|00000000||Geralt had spent years looking for Yennefer, only to have her find him. She had appeared outside the tavern in White Orchard, escorted by Nilfgaardian soldiers. The one-time lovers could not enjoy their reunion, for the sorceress had insisted they make haste.<br><br>Geralt and Yennefer had then left White Orchard accompanied by the Nilfgaardians, but only the witcher and the sorceress reached Vizima. Along the way their column was attacked by a cavalcade of wraiths: the omen of war - the Wild Hunt.<br><br>Geralt's head was abuzz with questions. What had Yen gotten into? How had the Hunt found them? Why was it looking for them? Why had he been summoned to Vizima? He was to get his answers from none other than the Emperor of Nilfgaard himself, Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. The most powerful man in the known world.<br>
   1051006|00000000||Short though it was, Geralt's audience with Emhyr proved substantial. The emperor's daughter and Geralt's erstwhile ward and friend, Cirilla, had returned from… a faraway land. She was in danger, her life was threatened - the Wild Hunt was pursuing her. Emhyr knew he had to find his long-unseen progeny before the wraiths did. First he had sought Yennefer's help. Yet they soon discovered that the sorceress' locating spells attracted the Hunt's attention. It was clear - they had to find Ciri without resorting to magic, employing only conventional means. Few men are better trackers than my old friend Geralt of Rivia, so Emhyr promised him a mountain of gold in exchange for his help. Yet Geralt accepted the task willingly - for personal, not material, reasons. This I know for certain, because of all the people in the world, Ciri was dearest to Geralt. He would do anything to save her.

   1061400|00000000||As an attentive reader you surely remember that the Wild Hunt could only be defeated with the help of powerful magic, and for this reason Geralt had recruited the most powerful sorceresses in the world, both those he liked and those he utterly detested, to join his cause. When a chance arose to add Fringilla Vigo to the roster, Geralt seized it without a moment's hesitation and went straightaway to the emperor's ship, where the dark-haired sorceress was being held.<br>
   1073609|00000000||Fringilla Vigo was the emperor's prisoner, and probably would have remained so till the end of her days if not for Yennefer's pact with Emhyr. He agreed to let the sorceress go - on condition she help in the fight against the Wild Hunt.<br>

    486128|00000000||I was hoping for a number ending in "teen."
    486130|00000000||Teen? How many "best men" you think I have?
    486174|00000000||Hm - more than three, maybe?
    486132|00000000||I'll give you your "teen" once you tell me what you're planning.
    486211|00000000||Need to attack a Temple Guard convoy.
    486228|00000000||Hm, wouldn't have any other favors to ask, would you? Search your heart, let me know, hm?
    486246|00000000||You can only give me three men, really?
    486248|00000000||Since you aim to stick your prick in the Eternal Fire itself, I can't even give you that number.
    486259|00000000||Mean you refuse to help?
    486261|00000000||I mean that at the appointed time and place, you will find six men waiting, who have absolutely nothing to do with me. Is that clear?
    486263|00000000||As a bright summer day. Thanks.
    486178|00000000||I want to attack a temple guard transport.
    486177|00000000||Can't say.
    486180|00000000||No can do.
    486182|00000000||So, where should this elite trio of my best meet you?
    486184|00000000||Dijkstra...
    486186|00000000||Shush! Remember: I'm Sigi.
    486209|00000000||Here of all places, I'd think we can talk freely. Or are you afraid your own men spy on you?
    486226|00000000||Of course they spy on me. I'd be disappointed if they didn't - after all, I do choose the very best.
    486270|00000000||So how many of your best can you give me, Sigi?
    486276|00000000||Ah, all right, you've convinced me. Four.
    486283|00000000||Fine.
    486122|00000000||Three's enough.
    486134|00000000||Then it's settled.
    486108|00000000||Three's good.
    480233|00000000||Need to ask you a favor.
    480234|00000000||Recently mentioned you, uh, have something of a soft spot for me. Gotta ask you a favor…
    480235|00000000||Oh-hoo! That's quite the start, Geralt. What's it you want?
    486094|00000000||Need to carry out an ambush. Could use a few of your men.
    486096|00000000||An ambush? What's this about?
    486098|00000000||Gimme men who'll survive the fight - they can tell you afterwards.
    480236|00000000||Heheh… I really do like you, Geralt. That's why I'll give you not one, not two, but three of my best men.

   1051260|00000000||Ah, if only human bodies could tolerate witcher potions! Sadly, Geralt could not administer such a toxic brew to the fisherman in good conscience, so the injured young man had to be content with some celandine. Not much, not much at all, but still, something.
   1051259|00000000||Age-old customs can be as dangerous as they are beautiful - a lesson learned the hard way by the two young fishermen Geralt encountered on Ard Skellig.

   1038361|00000000||Near the Nilfgaardian camp Geralt ran into a noblewoman from far-off Nazair. She had journeyed to the front in search of her son, a soldier. The woman was worried because her son would write her often, but at some point had suddenly stopped. No one in the camp knew what had happened to him, but the woman did not believe they were truly ignorant. She offered Geralt a reward for discovering the truth.<br>
   1038580|00000000||It turned out the noblewoman's son had decided to desert along with some other disgruntled soldiers. A search party had immediately been sent after them. Some were caught and killed, while others managed to escape. Sadly, the woman's son was among those hanged. When she learned this, she was overcome with grief. The letter Geralt had found on her son's body informed her how monstrous war can be and how hard it is to judge the actions of the soldiers taking part in it.

   1058845|00000000||Geralt encountered this young woman's ghost in the uppermost room in the haunted tower on Fyke Isle. She told him that in life she had been the local lord's daughter.<br><br>When enraged peasants stormed the tower, she feared they would ravage her honor if they found her alive and so took a magic potion that put her in a corpse-like state of paralysis. When she awoke, she found herself lying amidst the bodies of her family and servants, unable to move. She watched in helpless horror as rats feasted on the pile of corpses and began to nibble on her as well.<br><br>This grisly death must have somehow put a curse on her and the tower, for her ghost had wandered it in restless torment ever since. Geralt engaged his vast experience with such curses to search for a possible solution. Having learned that Anabelle had loved a simple fisherman named Graham, Geralt decided this man and the bond of true love the two youths shared could be their salvation.<br>
   1058846|00000000||Geralt agreed to take the young woman's remains to her love to have him give her a proper burial. Geralt hoped this would lift the evil spell on the cursed isle and bring Anabelle peace at long last.<br>
   1058847|00000000||Sadly, what Geralt took to be the ghost of an innocent woman was in fact death and disease in spirit form - a being known as a pesta, or plague maiden. Having lured Geralt into the open, it killed the unfortunate Graham and then escaped to spread the pox and feed on human suffering.<br><br>It is possible that this incident caused the local outbreak of Catriona that devastated the kingdom of Kerack and sowed the seeds of the coastal city's ultimate downfall.<br>
   1058848|00000000||Yet when Geralt tried to leave the tower, the wraith revealed its true nature. It turned out what Geralt took to be the ghost of an innocent girl was in fact a plague maiden - death and disease in spirit form.<br>
   1058849|00000000||Perhaps there was something in the girl's words that had put Geralt on his guard, or perhaps his witcher instincts simply warned him in time - either way, Geralt knew what he was dealing with a literal second before Anabelle revealed her true nature. The spirit was in fact a pesta - a plague maiden, a terrible wraith which spreads death and pestilence.<br>

   1044119|00000000||Geralt's search for the baron's wife and daughter took him to the local pellar, a sort of soothsayer and folk mage whom Geralt rightly suspected would be well informed about all local goings-on.<br><br>The pellar shared some juicy gossip with Geralt: supposedly the baron was a drunk and a terror to his family, and his wife's recent pregnancy had ended in a mysterious miscarriage.<br><br>The pellar's augurs showed that the miscarried fetus, undoubtedly discarded without a proper burial, had transformed into a dangerous monster: a botchling. The beast was murderous and foul, but could yet do some good. If its curse could be lifted and the monster could be turned into a lubberkin, this latter being, a friendly household guardian, could lead Geralt to the baron's wife and daughter.<br>
   1044126|00000000||Geralt's bosom boiled with wrath as he went to confront the baron. He was ready to drag the truth out of the man with a sword, force him to confess to what had truly happened that fateful night. A witcher in this state is even more effective than usual, so Geralt accomplished this in short order. The baron admitted that his wife had miscarried after one of their frequent rows, and that she and his daughter had fled Crow's Perch. He also agreed to show Geralt where he had buried the miscarried child's remains. When the clock struck midnight, both men set off to find the botchling's grave.<br>
   1044129|00000000||Once Geralt and the baron had reached the unborn babe's place of burial, they did not have to wait long for the botchling to show up. The beast hissed and howled and threatened to assume its more monstrous and vicious form, but the two men completed the naming ritual before it could. Then, following ancient custom, they buried the creature under the threshold so that in time it might be reborn as a lubberkin, a household guardian spirit. Geralt hoped this being would help him find the baron's family.<br>
   1044130|00000000||Once Geralt and the baron had reached the babe's place of burial, they did not have to wait long for the botchling to show up. When it did, the monster slayer slew the monster and collected some of its blood - this time not as a trophy but for use in an ancient ritual that, the witcher hoped, would provide him with more information about the fate of the baron's wife and daughter.<br>
   1044131|00000000||The baron's wife and daughter had not fled Crow's Perch's unaided - a fisherman living nearby had provided key assistance. Geralt went to the man's hut, where he learned a fiend had attacked the two women during their flight. The beast had torn Anna's horse to shreds, then carried her off into the woods.<br><br>One detail the fisherman mentioned rankled in the witcher's mind: it seemed Anna's hands bore strange marks that had burned with fire just moments before the fiend appeared. What could have caused them? What did they mean?<br><br>Geralt would have to endure this rankling until he found Anna, who, if still alive, had to be somewhere in Crookback Bog. Tamara, on the other hand, had made it to Oxenfurt, where the fisherman had helped her find shelter with his brother.<br>
   1044142|00000000||Upon hearing this, the baron revealed another scrap of information about Ciri. He told Geralt of a certain afternoon when he and his retinue had decided to celebrate a successful hunt with a bit of horse racing. The race had come to an abrupt halt, however, when a basilisk attacked. Here the baron employed an old storyteller's trick, breaking his tale off at a crucial moment and announcing he would not utter another word until Geralt found his wife.<br>
   1044143|00000000||Finding the baron's wife had proven far from simple, and the witcher, for neither the first nor the last time, only succeeded thanks to a chance discovery. While he was asking the Crones of Crookback Bog about Ciri, he noticed the old woman who served them bore unmistakable marks on her hands - the same burning symbols Anna had worn in the fisherman's tale. There was no room for doubt: this had to be her.<br>
   1044144|00000000||At long last, after Geralt had fulfilled his part of the bargain and found the baron's wife and daughter, the lord of Crow's Perch relieved the suspense and finished his tale. He recounted how Ciri had been forced to use her powers to save the baron's life. This had drawn the Wild Hunt's attention, so Ciri had had no choice but to flee once more - this time to the Free City of Novigrad. Geralt's search in Velen was at an end.
   1044108|00000000||The baron turned out to be a tough negotiator who knew the full value of the information he possessed. He agreed to tell Geralt about Ciri on one condition: Geralt had to find his wife and daughter first. The women had mysteriously disappeared a short time before. Though the baron had moved heaven and earth to find them, all his efforts had proved fruitless.<br>

   1077290|00000000||Ghouls and their more dangerous cousins, graveirs, usually feed in small groups, at times led by an alghoul. Since they delight most in the taste of fresh carcasses, they appear wherever newly-dug graves are to be found: cemeteries, crypts, catacombs and battlefields. Whenever the opportunity arises they hunt the living as well, especially when they have strength in numbers.<br><br>In a one-on-one fight with a trained witcher, a ghoul poses little threat, but one must remember that wounded individuals can erupt in a mad frenzy. At such times they attack fiercely, paying no heed to their own safety and brushing off all wounds. One must likewise bear in mind that ghouls and graveirs are particular dangerous around dusk and at night.

In part, they resemble humans - yet on the whole, they are the utter negation of all that is human. Though they have arms and legs like men, they walk on all fours like dogs or badgers. Though they have eerily familiar faces, one searches them in vain for any sign of sentiment, reason or even a spark of consciousness. They are driven by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable craving for human flesh.<br>

   1086957|00000000||<br> The witcher arrived at the cave too late to save the refugees - but he could still avenge their fate. He slew the powerful arachas and destroyed the eggs bearing its vile offspring.

   1081323|00000000||Velen's woods and bogs brim with monsters. This fact is well known, and thus when the war drove refugees into this hostile land, certain of their number thought to avoid the dangers of the lowlands by hiding in an abandoned mine. They were in for an unfortunate surprise. The shaft they chose for their sanctuary was inhabited by a poisonous arachas - a merciless and bloodthirsty monster.<br><br>The witcher knew he was in for a tough fight. The arachas had dwelled in the mine for years and had grown large and particularly strong and resilient in that time. Like other members of its vile species, it would be dangerous both at close quarters and at a distance. What's more, it was almost certainly venomous - he would need to imbibe Swallow or Golden Oriole (or both) before attacking if he was to stand a chance of surviving. As a small consolation, the witcher knew the monster would be vulnerable to his Signs - especially Igni, Aard and Yrden - as well as to the Northern Wind bomb.

   1044343|00000000||Oh, you fuckin' bitch.
   1058709|00000000||During Geralt's first encounter with "Baron" Phillip Strenger, he was puzzled by the man's many contradictions. This former Temerian soldier was most clearly an opportunist who, after his army's resounding defeat, served, dealt and negotiated with the occupying Nilfgaardian Empire. The local peasantry anointed him the "Bloody Baron," a clear indication that he was not prone to handle his vassals with kid gloves. On the other hand, he was a surprisingly gracious host to an unexpected guest who was also a stranger and a hired monster slayer.<br>
   1058710|00000000||Likewise contradicting his bandit-like appearance and terrifying nickname was his treatment of children and young women, to whom he displayed an entirely sincere and near fatherly concern. Ciri found this out for herself when she received care and shelter under his roof.<br>
   1058711|00000000||In exchange for information about Cirilla, the baron asked Geralt to help find his lost wife, Anna and his daughter, Tamara. Both had disappeared without a trace some time ago, and Phillip was slowly losing hope of ever seeing them again. In such a situation, a witcher was a gift from the gods.<br>
   1058712|00000000||Yet the baron had hid certain facts from Geralt, such as his wife's recent pregnancy, her subsequent miscarriage and his own predilection towards strong drink and violent quarrels.<br>
   1058722|00000000||It turned out the baron would drink regularly and to excess, and Geralt got a first-hand view of how dangerous he can be to those around him during such moments when he returned to talk to the baron about what he had learned from the Pellar. Phillip had known from the start that his wife and daughter had fled, not disappeared, but, torn between shame and concern over their fate, he had tried to save face while still doing all he could to find them.<br>
   1058723|00000000||On this subject there was no denying his determination. Paying no heed to the fact that a confrontation with the Crones might end tragically for him, he decided to ride into the swamps and try to free Anna from their clutches.<br>
   1058724|00000000||They say that a man's true nature is revealed in times of crisis. The baron's reunion with his wife was certainly such a time - her deplorable state shook Phillip to the core. Yet when he learned there was a sliver of hope that Anna could be cured of her madness, the baron seized that thought with all his strength and decided to rid with his wife to the very end of the earth, to the Blue Mountains, and seek help for her tortured mind there.<br>
   1058731|00000000||Despite the combined efforts of the baron, his men and Geralt, Anna could not be saved. Alas, this was not the end of the bad news - Tamara, who had also ventured into the swamp to save her mother, made it painfully clear to the baron that she no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. Having lost on all fronts and without uttering a single word, he trekked back to Crow Perch alone...<br>
   1058737|00000000||Despite the combined efforts of the baron, his men, Geralt and Tamara, who had come for her mother with an escort of witch hunters in tow, Anna could not be saved. The Crones had outwitted them all - they had crafted the curse so that lifting it would lead to Anna's death. The baron was completely shattered by this turn of events. Turning his back on them all, he trekked back to Crow Perch alone...<br>
   1058738|00000000||Not long afterwards Geralt learned that Phillip Strenger, the one-time terror of all of Velen, had hanged himself out of grief and despair, desolated by the loss of all that he had loved in his lifetime.

Not far from the keep, Geralt came across an area where the weather differed remarkably from that of its surroundings. He decided to investigate what sort of forces were at work.<br>
   1053398|00000000||After a brief investigation, the witcher was able to conclude that the weather anomaly was the doing of one of the resident mages of Kaer Morhen, who had created a sort of outdoor greenhouse in which to cultivate the herbs used for the Trial of the Grasses. Though you might not know this, Geralt is quite the handyman, something which came in handy (pun unintended) at this time. He banged and nudged the broken magical apparatus and returned it to working order in no time. Before long, rare herbs were growing outside Kaer Morhen once again.

    565142|00000000||But enough about that. Find some buckthorn and we'll finish what they started.
    565221|00000000||Hm-hm. Fine, if everything's ready, say the word and we'll get to work.
    565219|00000000||All right, about the griffin - learn what you can. We gotta make a lure that'll work. Soon as we do, we can start.

    533082|00000000||Been busy with the griffin contract.
    533083|00000000||And?
    564842|00000000||Wanted to let you know it'll be a bit longer.
    564843|00000000||Fine. I'll wait.
    533025|00000000||I'm ready. No point in waiting. Let's find a good spot to ambush it.
    533097|00000000||Picked one out already. Other side of the stream - there's fields and a grove. Plenty of room and far enough so no one'll get in our way.
    575755|00000000||Good. Meet you there.
    533093|00000000||Time to set the trap.
    533086|00000000||See you.
    533094|00000000||Later, Vesemir.
    564838|00000000||Need help?
    564840|00000000||Running through the fields, picking herbs? Thanks, think I'll manage.
    565131|00000000||And how's that going?
    533272|00000000||I've accepted a contract for the griffin.
    532999|00000000||Got good news and bad news.
    533087|00000000||Good news first - captain of the Nilfgaardian garrison knows where Yennefer went.
    533088|00000000||And the bad's that we have to kill the griffin for him.
    564816|00000000||What else could he want from two witchers? Go on, tell me what you know.

Geralt met this extraordinary man in Skellige, where he had gone to hunt the notorious Grossbart brothers.

   1051136|00000000||The job was done. The world was finally free of those ruthless and bloodthirsty brothers. And it was all due to the brave Djenge Frett - and my dear friend, Geralt of Rivia.

One of their favorites - horse racing at night and the chance for friendly (and not-so-friendly) betting that went along with it. Though the witcher had plenty of other things to occupy his time, he decided he could spare a few moments to take part in these races.<br>
   1053128|00000000||Geralt was the first to ride past the finish line - which should come as no surprise, given all the time he had spent in the saddle and the fact that, unlike all the other participants, he could see in the dark.

   1051827|00000000||Geralt was only able to escape from Madman Lugos' prison thanks to the help of a mysterious old man called Simun Brambling. It was he who convinced the guard to let Geralt out, warning Geralt first that he would one day demand a favor in return. Geralt had managed to forget about the whole incident - but not Simun. The old man found Geralt and demanded he repay his debt.<br>
   1051829|00000000||Geralt decided he'd rather stain his honor than spill the blood of an innocent man. Simun did not accept this excuse and decided to kill Geralt alongside his age-old rival. The old warrior underestimated the witcher, however, and after a short fight he died from wounds delivered by the witcher's blade.
   1051828|00000000||Geralt did what Simun demanded - he killed a man who had done him no wrong. As you can see, dear reader, at times one must act dishonorably in order to maintain one's honor.

    377688|00000000||Aye, he did. Such spirit! Stormed in, swept the bowls off the table, jumped atop of it, and cried: "I'm sailin' off to seek glory, who's with me? Who wants to cut off that bloody giant's head?!"
    377690|00000000||Guess that was enough to recruit a longboat full of men.

    522281|00000000||As I recall, Vigi wanted to cross a frozen lake and scale the mountains.
    424312|00000000||They say the giant came from there, awoken by the frost that gripped the land around the tower.
    424314|00000000||Twas a harsh winter, suited that man-eater perfectly! And it can only get worse! Even the gods… well… hm.

   1054653|00000000||As you surely recall, Geralt knew Ciri had been in Novigrad, that she had contacted Dudu and me and that afterwards all three of us had plummeted straight into a writhing snake pit of trouble. The last person to have seen Ciri was yours truly, but I, too, had disappeared without a trace. Geralt accurately surmised that Dudu would be the easiest of our ill-fated trio to find. He went to the one person who could help him do this - Priscilla.<br>
   1054654|00000000||It should be noted that Priscilla counted an incomparable ingenuity amongst her many virtues. Barely had Geralt explained the problem when she hit upon a solution. Dudu had taken on some unknown form and gone into hiding. Their only hope of luring him out - a clear sign from his old friends in Madame Irina's mummers' troupe. <br><br>Priscilla thus decided to put on a play - one Dudu would be sure to attend and that would clearly convey it was safe for him to reveal himself. Geralt agreed to the plan and the two got down to work.<br>
   1054655|00000000||The play was a success. Although not the finest spectacle to ever grace the Butcher's Yard, it more than sufficed for Priscilla's purposes - Dudu attended the play and revealed himself at its end. Geralt quickly pulled him behind the curtain and began questioning him about me and Ciri. This is how the witcher learned I was a prisoner of the Church of the Eternal Fire.
   1049272|00000000||Tell Priscilla what you've learned about Dudu.

   1084793|00000000||While strolling the bustling streets of Novigrad, Geralt came across a most intriguing notice. It suggested the man named de Jonkheer had sold some poor fool the house which Sara, the lovable yet mischievous godling, used as her dwelling and playground. The notice made it clear the new owner was not amused by his unwanted tenant's pranks. Geralt decided to check up on how Sara and see how she was doing...<br>
   1084794|00000000||Geralt wasn't sure what he expected to find in the "haunted house" - but it sure wasn't that. The dreamer, having learned about Sara from Geralt, had decided to get to know her.

   1077752|00000000||<i>Barely nicked me, I'll be fine.</i><br>– Last words of an unknown hunter <br><br>Though all arachasae are highly venomous, this breed produces an especially strong toxin. A few drops are enough to kill a grown man – unless that man is a witcher, whose mutations will neutralize small amounts of this venom. Large quantities, however, will kill anything they touch, with mutations only prolonging an inevitable and painful death in such instances.<br>
   1077753|00000000||Venomous arachasae produce colossal amounts of this toxin and deploy it during combat in many ways. Before striking a venomous arachas will cover its pincers and teeth with a thick coating of this deadly liquid. It will then squirt the venom at its to its opponent to weaken it, and once locked in direct combat, will continue spraying the noxious ooze all around itself, meaning every breath brings its victim closer to death. Like other members of this species, venomous arachasae use prehensile feelers to grab and immobilize their prey. When attempting to fight such a creature a witcher should drink Golden Oriole, which will reduce his body's vulnerability to poison, and then attack from a safe distance with crossbow or bombs before dealing the finishing blows with a silver sword enhanced with a coating of insectoid oil.

   1061654|00000000||Vesemir was the oldest living member of the Wolf School and most likely the oldest witcher of any school on the Continent.<br><br>About as long in years as the ruins of Kaer Morhen themselves and though eternally complaining about his creaky bones, this master of the witcher trade gave no thought to a well-deserved retirement. Gray but still spry, he continued to ply the monster hunting trade into his golden years - effectively, too, as he'd seen more beasts than all his students put together.<br><br>A harsh and demanding instructor in Geralt's youth, over the years he had become something of an adoptive father and mentor to the other witchers, always ready to help with sage advice and steady hands.<br>
   1061655|00000000||In the spring of 1272, when our story begins, Vesemir had joined Geralt on his search for Yennefer, trekking with him through war-ravaged Temeria.<br>
   1061656|00000000||Vesemir always said no witcher had ever died in his own bed, so death in combat surely awaited him as well. Death's waiting ended on the mournful day when the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen in pursuit of Ciri. Vesemir gave his all to protect his former ward, whom he had always treated like an adopted granddaughter, and died a hero's death at the hands of Imlerith, the Hunt's cruel general.

   1053056|00000000||In Skellige Geralt met a desperate and broken man named Lothar. Someone had cast a powerful curse on his son, causing him to slip closer and closer towards the grave with each passing day. The witcher knew he had to lift the curse before it was too late.<br>
   1053057|00000000||The witcher discovered the curse had been cast by the local herbalist, Jonna, with whom Lothar had once shared his bed. Once again it was proven - something which I, dear reader, know all too well - that man knows no greater enemy than a woman scorned. Geralt was able to save the man's son, but the spell demanded a victim. The disease moved to Jonna, dragging her into a painful and premature death.

According to legend, dragons like to savor the delicate notes of virgins, while ghouls delight in the powerful flavors of rotting flesh. In the woods outside Novigrad, meanwhile, a beast had cropped up with a predilection for Redanian transport wagons. Not surprisingly, the captain of the nearby guardpost did not appreciate this culinary choice and put out a bounty on the monster's head.<br>
   1053022|00000000||It turned out the woods did not hide a "shaggy fuck-knows-what," as the captain of the guard put it, but a band of Scoia'tael. They were the ones attacking the transports. Geralt promised not to betray their secret, but in the end he changed his mind. You might say, dear reader, that he acted dishonorable, and you'd probably be right - but those Scoia'tael were no innocents themselves.<br>

His needle pointed decidedly towards the elves' much-deserved death.

   1050860|00000000||Nothing about sorceresses should be taken at face value. Their faces least of all - those perfect, ever youthful visages have as little to do with nature as Hierarch Hemmelfart has with charity. If anyone should have learned to think twice when dealing with them, it was Geralt, and yet still he accepted Keira's dinner invitation.<br><br>During what Geralt naively thought to be innocent conversation between friends, Keira tricked him into revealing information about the mage Alexander's laboratory and then, when he was least expecting it, sent him to sleep with a spell so he could not stop her from carrying out her nefarious plans...<br>
   1050862|00000000||Yet Geralt did not allow Keira to triumph. He sensed she wanted Alexander's notes on the Catriona plague for her own immoral ends and so stopped her from leaving Velen. This led to a fight during which Geralt was forced to take Keira's life. And so, in this most unfortunate and disheartening way, their stormy relationship came to an end.
   1050861|00000000||Geralt caught Keira red-handed as she was leaving the tower with the results of Alexander's research on the Catriona plague. Although he feared the sorceress would use these notes for nefarious purposes, Geralt decided to let her go. Whether it was because he ultimately believed her assurances that no one would suffer as a result of her actions, or because he wanted to avoid a potentially bloody conflict - difficult to tell. Geralt is a man of many secrets, including ones he keeps even from me.<br>
   1050863|00000000||After leaving Velen Keira went to see King Radovid. The sorceress hoped the king would realize the importance of Alexander's research and pardon her earlier crimes so that she could continue the experiments at his court, with the aim of producing a cure for Catriona - or finding a way to turn it into an unprecedentedly destructive weapon.<br><br>Yet while Radovid shall go down in history for many reasons, being a patron of the sciences or a merciful ruler will not be among them. And so Keira found no amnesty or laboratory waiting for her, but instead only a cruel and painful death.
   1054766|00000000||Geralt caught Keira red-handed as she was leaving the tower with the results of Alexander's research on the Catriona plague. She was convinced these notes could be used to find a cure for this decimating disease. What's more, she hoped that the prospect of obtaining such a cure would convince King Radovid to let bygones be bygones and host Keira at his court. I doubt Radovid would have proven so broad-minded - luckily, Geralt convinced Keira to abandon these foolish hopes and give Oxenfurt a miss, seeking shelter at Kaer Morhen instead.
   1087104|00000000||Geralt was understandably less than pleased with Keira's treatment of him, but he decided to let the sorceress go. He felt whatever she was scheming was not more important than the great tasks he had before him at that moment.

Hushed legends speak of them losing their way at times and descending from the night sky to earth, cold and death following in their wake.</i><br>– Essi "Blackjack" Daven, trobairitz <br><br>Born, or so some experts believe, of magic ice crystal, the Hounds of the Wild Hunt race alongside their spectral masters. Like ravenous, feral dogs they are capable only of mindlessly attacking whatever crosses their path.<br>
   1077936|00000000||The Hounds' chief weapons are their claws and teeth. Their battle tactics rely on knocking their opponents to the ground before tearing them to shreds. Badly wounded Hounds fall into a kind of frenzy that adds to their deadly might. These beasts also use their powers over the cold to freeze the ground around them and create sharp spikes of ice. Creatures born of frost, they feel pain from the Igni Sign, and there is also reason to believe Axii can momentarily weaken their drive to kill and somewhat weaken these fierce foes.<br><br>The Hounds' icy nature also means they can draw strength from extreme cold. Thus one should be particularly on guard when fighting them during blizzards or in glacial regions. Elven legends likewise claim they gain strength when a red moon - a known herald of the Hunt's arrival - hangs in the sky.

   1002636|00000000||Ciri pulled Geralt aside for a confidential heart-to-heart. She confided to him that Avallac'h had a hidden lair, a secret place that not even Ciri, his star pupil and long-time traveling companion, had been allowed to visit. Intrigued, Geralt decided to enter this secret lair and find out what the Seer was hiding.<br><br>The most important part of any conspiracy is for the co-conspirators to trust each other fully, and Ciri's revelation had cast a shadow of suspicion on Avallac'h. Geralt knew light must be shed on this shadow before it proved too late.<br>
   1002637|00000000||It turned out Avallac'h's well-guarded secret was a hidden laboratory in which he carried out research on Lara Dorren's gene - the gene Ciri bore within her, the cause of her power and her misfortune. Ciri was understandably less than thrilled to see herself through Avallac'h's eyes as a subject in some twisted experiment.<br><br>Meanwhile, they also discovered this secret research wasn't the only reason the Seer kept the place hidden. Avallac'h seemed to have been using it as a pleasure alcove for trysts with his elven lover. Who would have thought? It turns out even the wisest of sages is not always driven by pure reason alone.

   1048619|00000000||That the Wild Hunt would come for Ciri as soon as Geralt found her was more than certain. The witcher thus decided to prepare to fend off their inevitable attack and asked all the friends he deemed capable of facing the Hunt in battle to lend their blade - or wand, or axe, or druid's staff, or whatever their chosen death-dealing instrument might be. The site he chose for the battle against the fiercest foe he'd ever crossed - Kaer Morhen. Where else?<br>
   1048620|00000000||Geralt crisscrossed the Continent and gathered a crew of the most talented individuals of his time - the fighters, that is, talented lovers, such as myself, not being needed at this moment. The next step? Defeat the Wild Hunt.
   1048621|00000000||Pride? Sloth? A reluctance to risk his friends' lives? Whatever the reason, in the end Geralt did not ask everyone who might have aided him for help. Luckily he could always count on the help of the witchers of Kaer Morhen, as well as that of Yennefer, to whom Ciri was like a daughter.

   1077703|00000000||This elemental attacks using fireballs and streams of flame which reduce anything in their path to ashes in the blink of an eye. Like golems and other elementals, poison does not touch it nor does it bleed. Fire-based spells not only do no harm but in fact strengthen it - thus one should by no means think of striking it with Igni. Though vulnerable to  silver blades, getting within sword's reach of one is dangerous due to the furnace-like heat they emanate. When fighting a fire elemental one should thus strike from a distance, using frost-spewing and dimeritium bombs, for they will do it the most damage.
   1077702|00000000||<i>The first fire elemental was created by Ransant Alvaro. Sadly, flames engulfed his entire laboratory, burning it - along with every other building on his block - to ash.</i><br>– Tarvix Sandoval, "Origins of Magic Arcana"<br><br>Fire is the most destructive of the elements, thus the aggressive lethality of the creature that embodies its essence should come as no surprise. Fire elementals are forged in complicated magic rituals for one purpose: destruction. And they pursue this with murderous determination.<br>

   1076089|00000000||Yet Roche and Geralt did not come to the rescue in time. Ves fought to save the peasants of Mulbrydale - though she knew full well she stood no chance of winning against her substantially more numerous opponents. No historian will write of this struggle, nor will any bard sing of it, and no gravestone shall mark Ves' resting place.
   1086305|00000000||Vernon Roche fell into dour spirits after Geralt's conversation with Radovid at the chess club. He didn't want to say right then what had blackened his mood. Instead, he asked the witcher to come talk to him at his hideout near Oxenfurt.

The fact remains, however, that he never met up with Roche and never found out what the former Blue Stripes commander had been scheming.
   1087096|00000000||Geralt's first reflex was to agree to help Roche with his trouble with Ves, but when he thought things over, he concluded he shouldn't get involved in an internal conflict between a superior and his subordinate.

    569701|00000000||What's your story? You actually kill your father?
    569703|00000000||Twas an evil man. The pellar feared him once, but then grew brave.
    569705|00000000||What his father did to his mother… the pellar could not look upon it.
    569707|00000000||So he split the father's head with an axe. Left him in the swamp… But folk knew…

    466831|00000000||While meandering through the sunny but war-damaged lands near Oxenfurt, Geralt's sensitive ears picked up a very strange sound - something between off-key singing and the bellowing of a stuck pig. Geralt would be a poor excuse for a witcher if he did not investigate such a matter.<br>
   1051219|00000000||It turned out the dubious musical talents belonged to a troll who believed himself part of the Redanian army. His fondest dream was for fort he had been assigned to guard to look like a proper Redanian fort. Bear in mind that a troll's mental capacity is roughly that of a none-too-bright toddler, and you'll understand why this particular one felt a Redanian fort should be painted in bright Redanian colors. Geralt brought him red and white paint, which made him as happy as a child finding a present under his pillow.<br>

   1086971|00000000||<br>The witcher killed Melusine and along with her the sirens that made up her ghastly entourage. The inhabitants of Svorlag needed fear her no longer - and could now gather the remains of their loved ones from her cave.
   1087405|00000000||<i>I… I saw a shadow… Great wings, like a cloud passin' o'er the sky. Then I heard him scream.</i><br>– Britt of Svorlag<br>
   1081807|00000000||In the mountains near the village of Svorlag in Skellige lies an enormous complex of caves. For many centuries they were given wide berth on account of the bloodthirsty ekhidna known as Melusine who had made them into her lair.<br><br>Melusine was a beast so powerful some islanders worshipped her as a semi-divine being. The witcher, however, harbored no such delusions. He knew she was an extremely powerful monster - but a monster all the same. This meant she could be killed. To do so, he would need the highest quality of bolts, a solid silver blade - and a steady hand.

   1059694|00000000||Bart, the troll guarding Dijkstra's treasure, could have been the poster boy for the latest craze among Novigrad's wealthy strata, a trend that had swept over everyone from bankers and merchants to underworld crime bosses. The fashion in question prized guards marked not just by fierce loyalty, but also by massive size, endless stamina and crushing physical strength. A well-developed intellect, on the other hand, was considered unnecessary and quite possibly detrimental to the guard's performance. To be blunt, a good watchman should be brainless enough to render any thought of betraying his master impossible.<br><br>That is why trolls, ogres and, as a last result, magic crossbreeds were highly prized for such roles.

    397165|00000000||Geralt's first clue? A brutally murdered and mangled body. The villagers all agreed the Woodland Spirit had killed the man - but their explanations of this creature's motives could not have been more different. The elders among them claimed the Spirit, who had cared for their village for generations, was now punishing them for having broken the pact they had once made. As for the youth present, they claimed the Woodland Spirit was nothing but a cruel brute that killed for its own pleasure - and that rather than worship it, they should get rid of it once and for all.<br><br>Geralt promised to help with their problem - though he did not yet know which side was right. The witcher exercised his better judgment and decided his first move must be to find out what this Woodland Spirit really was - and why it had begun to kill.<br>
    397254|00000000||Fayrlund's supposed guardian turned out to be a leshen - a rare and dangerous monster that can force animals, plants and, as soon became clear, even people to do its bidding. For generations the villagers had worshipped it and offered it sacrifices, and all the while it leeched off their life force, a parasite masquerading as a guardian. A band of young warriors led by Sven questioned the old order and asked Geralt to take care of the monster in the manner of witchers.<br><br>Geralt agreed. While he was away tracking the leshen in the nearby woods, Sven decided to usher in the new era himself by murdering all the village elders. When Geralt arrived back in the settlement it was too late to save it from fratricidal bloodshed. He thus collected his reward from a man who had killed more people in one afternoon than the monster had in years and walked away from the village without a backwards glance.<br>
    397290|00000000||Geralt made two discoveries during his investigation. First of all, the Woodland Spirit turned out to be a leshen - a rare monster, though one known to witchers. Secondly, to his great surprise Geralt found that this beast truly did help the village of Fayrlund, training the villagers in dark rituals how to become unequaled hunters and warriors. Those who didn't survive its trials never returned from the woods - their lives were the price the monster demanded. <br><br>The monster had become intertwined with the village - so integral to their way of life that Geralt decided it was safer to renew the old pacts made with the beast than to kill it. The village youth, however, could not be reconciled to a return to the old order. Though lacking the courage to kill the hated Woodland Spirit themselves, they mustered enough bravery to rise up against the elders who worshipped it. Geralt left the village before the bloodshed started. After all, the role of a witcher is to protect men from monsters, not from themselves.

Secondly, to his great surprise Geralt found that this beast truly did help the village of Fayrlund, training their hunters and warriors in the nearby woods - though it exacted a price in human lives.<br><br>Even so, the witcher decided more good would come from renewing the old pact between the villagers and the leshen than from killing the beast. Harald, leader of the village elders, rewarded the witcher for keeping the old traditions alive. The village youth, however, with Sven in the lead, could not be reconciled to a return to the old order. Though lacking the courage to kill the hated Woodland Spirit themselves, they mustered enough bravery to rise up against the elders who worshipped it.<br><br>It fell upon Geralt yet again to choose the lesser evil. He defended some men by killing others - even more, perhaps, than the monster he was supposed to protect them against.

   1086448|00000000||Crossing a certain Skellige isle, Geralt overheard a group of islanders discussing the tragic death of a man named Arnulf. Sensing a monster contract might be in the offing, he decided to look in to the matter.

   1055870|00000000||The merchant Geralt found standing by the side of the road in White Orchard was extremely distraught. He had been hauling some precious goods to the Nilfgaardian camp when his horse spooked and veered off the road, pulling the merchant's cart with it and dumping the whole works in the foggy swamp outside the camp. The poor horse became trapped in the muck and soon was devoured by the monsters who inevitably lurk in such places. The merchant was understandably afraid to go retrieve his goods, and thus asked the witcher to do it for him - in return for a sizable reward.<br>
   1055871|00000000||The witcher found the merchant's priceless cargo and the grateful man repaid him in gold for his trouble. The contract had turned out to be a simple one, without any moral dilemmas or wrenching doubts about where lesser evil lay, and to top it all off it ended with a satisfactory and immediately-paid reward - the witcher surely wished they could all be like that.<br>
   1055872|00000000||Seemingly straightforward stories often turn out to be anything but. The witcher found the merchant's cart - and beside it signs of a malicious attack organized by human hands. It seemed the merchant had not told Geralt the whole truth. The confrontation that followed confirmed the witcher's suspicions - rather than stay to plead his innocence, the merchant immediately ran as fast as his legs could take him.<br>
   1055873|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. After Geralt heard the man explain his story and motives, he decided to let him go to continue his futile battle against the Nilfgaardian occupiers. Do not act so surprised, dear reader - witchers might be neutral by principle, but it was no secret where Geralt's sympathies lay in the struggle between the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br>
   1055874|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. Though Geralt was skeptical about the man's chances in his partisan struggle against the mighty Nilfgaardian occupier, he decided to let him go... but kept the priceless object for himself. Perhaps he thought rewarding a cheat would not be the proper thing to do - or perhaps he was driven by a simple need for coin. It is not my place to judge, dear reader.<br>
   1055875|00000000||It turned out the "merchant" was no merchant at all, but a Temerian guerrilla. With his back against the wall, the soldier called on high ideals and Geralt's sense of patriotism in order to convince the witcher of the worthiness of his cause - but to no avail, for Geralt nevertheless handed him over to the nearest Nilfgaardian outpost. The witcher was clearly of the opinion that someone who acts like a bandit should end like a bandit, no matter how lofty his declared motives.<br>
   1055876|00000000||Geralt chased after the lying merchant but the scoundrel managed to give him the slip. He never did find out what really had happened out there in the murky swamps of White Orchard.<br>

   1054948|00000000||Ah, what times those were, times of adventure, action and unexpected twists around every corner! As you surely recall, Ciri and I escaped from Whoreson Junior's headquarters only to wind up trapped in a corner by the Temple Guard. Ciri managed to get away, but I was captured and tossed in the Temple Isle dungeons. From there I was to be transported to Deireadh, the infamous Oxenfurt prison, to await my execution - and here my tale would surely end, had my friends not devised an ingenious plan to ambush the transport.<br>
   1054991|00000000||Yet even the best-laid plans can go awry if fortune deems it so. The ambush succeeded only partially, as one of the guards tossed me on his horse and fled in the heat of the action. Not losing my cool for my second, I quickly concocted a plan of my own, and it had almost come to fruition when Geralt burst in and broke me free in his typical clumsy yet, granted, effective way. But do not think me ungrateful or cold-hearted - any irritation I felt soon faded in the sincere joy that filled my heart upon seeing my old friend once more.

   1086979|00000000||Some monsters are so powerful local populaces begin worshipping them as gods. Such was the case with the leshen dwelling in the woods near the Skellige village of Fayrlund. The elders were absolutely convinced the monster watched over them by defending them from their enemies and training their hunters.<br><br>The witcher had his doubts, however. Leshens are mean, self-serving creatures - and the ancient one living in the woods near Fayrlund was surely no exception.<br><br>Geralt knew freeing the villagers from their supposed protector's grasp would be no easy task - if he decided to even try. The leshen known as the Woodland Spirit was so powerful as to have mastered the art of marking. This meant the monster had inserted his essence into one of the residents of Fayrlund. As long as this unfortunate soul remained alive and near the settlement, the leshen would always be reborn near its lair.<br><br>Yet even with the marked one eliminated, killing the leshen would be no easy task. The monster commanded the obedience of the denizens of the woods - it could thus call on wolves, ravens or even the trees themselves for help. Luckily, it had a weakness as well: it was vulnerable to fire, that born of the Igni Sign in particular.
   1086980|00000000||<br>The witcher managed to kill the leshen, ending the murders terrorizing the woods around Fayrlund. Yet this did not mean the villagers' troubles were over…
   1086981|00000000||<br>In the end, however, there never was a battle between Geralt and the Woodland Spirit. Geralt knew that the leshen was surely less benevolent than the elders thought - but he also knew killing it would do more harm than good.

   1058808|00000000||Graden was one of the witch hunters in King Radovid's service. Unlike a great many of his comrades, he came across as a level-headed fellow, one free from prejudice, at least in his dealings with witchers.<br>
   1058812|00000000||Geralt's subsequent encounters with Graden confirmed his suspicion that the man was not a typical hunter. Graden was unorthodox in his methods, prioritizing results over ideological purity and a strict adherence to the hunters' codex, even though, as he was undoubtedly aware, this approach would hardly endear him to his superiors.<br><br>After the affair in the swamp was over, he returned to Oxenfurt, taking Tamara with him.

   1050963|00000000||Once again Geralt had a near impossible choice to make - a choice between a greater and lesser evil. While preparing to hunt the griffin, he had come across one of the beast's victims - a simple peasant woman named Lena. She had been on her way to meet her lover when the griffin attacked. The beast had mortally wounded her. A witcher's potion could save her life… or cause her to perish in agony.<br>
   1050967|00000000||The witcher decided to help Lena. Geralt then left White Orchard before he could learn the results of the risky treatment he applied. Soon afterwards, while visiting the Nilfgaardian garrison in Velen, he learned the woman had survived. The imperial infantryman with whom she was to meet the ill-fated evening of the griffin's attack had brought her to a nearby village. Sadly, none of this denoted a happy ending. Though the wounds on Lena's body had healed, the toxins in the witcher's brew had melted her mind. This was not the first time a cure had proven worse than the disease.<br>
   1059003|00000000||They say witchers do not feel as humans do. That they are stripped of emotion, untroubled by doubts and dilemmas. This might be true for some of the caste - Lambert possibly being a case in point. But there is no doubt Geralt was different. He honestly debated what to do with Lena, considered what would be the lesser evil, and did so for so long that the woman finally succumbed to her wounds.

Days had passed, their wedding drew nearer and nearer, and neither the brothers nor the betrothed had arrived. The man asked Geralt for help.<br>
   1053120|00000000||Sadly, this story had an unhappy ending. The groom's brothers and betrothed had been struck by a storm during their voyage. The girl had perished, her dowry lost.

   1075678|00000000||Though Geralt avoided politics like the plague, there were times when he simply couldn't avoid getting entangled. This was very much the case when Roche and Dijkstra convinced him to find their co-conspirator. The man had gone off undercover to resolve a certain matter among the Nilfgaardians and simply disappeared.<br>
   1075679|00000000||It turned out the missing co-conspirator was none other than Thaler - Geralt's old acquaintance from Vizima, a man of many talents and a tongue to make a sailor blush. He was traveling disguised as a shoemaker when trolls seized him and demanded he cobble them up some decent footwear - like the kind humans have. Thaler didn't thrive in troll captivity and so was delighted to see Geralt, who took out his large oppressors with ease. Geralt had hoped that once he freed Thaler he'd learn something more about the mysterious plan to assassinate King Radovid, but Thaler's lips remained firmly sealed...
   1086575|00000000||Upon finding Dijkstra mingling among the fugitive mages, then watching him assist them in their flight, Geralt got the sinking feeling the erstwhile spy would want a favor in return. He could not have been more correct, for as soon as the mages had set sail for Kovir's hospitable shores, Dijkstra confessed that he had set in motion a plot to assassinate Radovid and asked the witcher to meet him promptly at the Passiflora.
   1087097|00000000||Dijkstra can be quite convincing at times, but on this occasion Geralt's reluctance to get involved in political matters won out over his curiosity and desire to earn some coin. Besides, doing a contract for Dijkstra's one thing, but participating in a coup - that's another thing altogether. Geralt decided to keep his distance, and hoped by doing so to keep his head as well...
   1087098|00000000||When he learned Dijkstra and Roche were planning to find the missing spy, Geralt agreed to help - after all, a missing man's a missing man, and deserves aid whether he's a tinker, a tailor, a soldier or… well, you get the point. But when he thought things over more carefully, he concluded he shouldn't meddle in high politics, and he especially shouldn't participate in an assassination - and that's exactly what he'd be doing by finding the missing spy. He thus abandoned the task, and Roche and Dijkstra never mentioned the unfortunate matter again.

   1060976|00000000||Most druids in Skellige differ from the deeply-rooted Continental stereotype of a graybearded old man in white robes bowing before sacred oaks, taming wyverns and pestering local lords with petitions to add yet another species to the list of protected beasts. Ermion, Geralt's old acquaintance, was no exception in this regard.<br><br>This stiff-bearded, spindly man was the leader of the Druids' Circle in Skellige. He was also Jarl Crach an Craite's advisor on matters of magic and the mystical, as well as on any and all issues requiring more refinement than a well-timed uppercut or a hard-swung axe.<br><br>Ermion was known to be obstinate and to have a tendency, quite rare in Skellige, to consider all possible consequences of a particular course of action before it was undertaken. All this meant that conversing with him demanded a considerable amount of time and patience.<br>
   1060978|00000000||Given all this, one can hardly be surprised that Yennefer and Geralt's "rash" and "highly irresponsible" actions regarding the magic anomaly - stealing a priceless artifact from a private chamber being first among them - put Ermion quite out of sorts.<br>
   1060979|00000000||However, despite his difficult character and his somewhat testy relationship with Geralt, Ermion agreed at once to travel to Kaer Morhen and help defend Ciri from the Wild Hunt's forces.<br>
   1060985|00000000||When persuasion and reason failed, Ermion would, as a last resort, turn to violence - and then he became a foe to be reckoned with.<br><br>Madman Lugos found this out personally when, in a fit of rage, he attacked Ermion and Geralt. As they had in the past, witcher and druid stood side by side and fought a common enemy.

Geralt thus sought out some of his long-time companions for a hand or two of gwent - and the chance to win powerful cards from each of them.<br>
   1078438|00000000||Geralt had a wonderful time slapping down cards with familiar faces and added several powerful new cards to his collection while he was at it.

   1049838|00000000||Crach an Craite, an old friend, invited Geralt and Yennefer to a farewell feast for the recently-departed King Bran. One does not refuse such invitations in Skellige, and so, willing or not, Geralt had no choice but to meet Yennefer at the castle gates and attend the wake at her side.<br>
   1049891|00000000||Bran's wake was in full swing, with mead flowing plentifully and Geralt making quite a splash with the jarls, when suddenly Yennefer announced she needed to meet with the witcher in a more private setting. Yet she did not have in mind what you do, dear reader. Instead, she wanted Geralt to accompany her as she broke into the druid Ermion's laboratory. Her goal? To steal the artifact known as the Mask of Uroboros.<br>As you can see, life with Yennefer was full of surprises, a fact Geralt had grown used to and even, one dares say, quite fond of.<br>
   1049894|00000000||After much wandering, Yennefer had finally found the mask she had been seeking. When Ermion's laboratory grew dangerous, she teleported herself and Geralt back to her quarters. Once there, they… well, what they did is not really any of your concern, dear reader.<br><br>Afterwards, they returned to the wake.<br>
   1049898|00000000||Crach an Craite only arrived as the wake was drawing to a close - he and the other jarls had locked themselves away in a proverbial smoke-filled room to scheme plans for Skellige's future. That business finished, he now pulled Geralt and Yen aside for a talk. When he heard they were searching for Ciri, he agreed at once to provide them with everything they needed.<br><br>Luckily for Crach's treasury, Yennefer did not need everything, just Ermion's permission to examine a mysteriously deformed forest - the result of a magic explosion that might have involved Ciri.<br>Crach promised to convince Ermion, and as his word was as reliable as his beard was red, Geralt and Yennefer set off at once towards the magic-damaged woods.
   1049895|00000000||After much wandering Yennefer finally acquired the mask she sought. As Ermion's laboratory had grown rather dangerous, she teleported Geralt and herself back to the wake, where they landed with a thud in the middle of the ongoing party. Luckily all the feastgoers were already too inebriated to notice anything out of the usual.<br>

This drive burned all the higher when she learned from Avallac'h that Imlerith, the general of the Hunt who murdered Vesemir, would be attending the Crones' sabbath on Bald Mountain. Ciri smelled blood and decided at once to travel to No Man's Land and kill Imlerith. Geralt, that calculating, practical-minded witcher, as usual caved immediately to his adopted daughter's wishes and agreed to accompany her on this expedition. The pair thus slipped out of Kaer Morhen in the cool light of morning and galloped off to find vengeance.<br>
   1053564|00000000||Vengeance is what they found, and, though served warm, it was nonetheless sweet. The duo found their way to the top of Bald Mountain and there Ciri killed two of the three Crones while Geralt triumphed in a deathmatch against Imlerith.

   1056325|00000000||Emhyr var Emreis had been searching for his daughter Ciri for quite some time. Even the most dubious sighting of an ashen-haired young woman with a scar on her cheek would send imperial spies scurrying.<br><br>Not even the harsh conditions of war-ravaged Velen deterred them - indeed, it is there they had been most successful, determining that Ciri had been, and possibly still was, in the region. Reports of a similar nature had also come in from Novigrad, but remained unconfirmed. Emhyr's spooks had gathered nothing concrete from Skellige, but an explosion of magical energy had taken place on one of the isles, and it seemed likely that Ciri had been somehow involved.<br>
   1058834|00000000||During his search, Geralt discovered that Ciri had indeed spent time in each of these places and, though the Lion Cub herself remained at large, he found someone who had until recently been her companion. There was one catch, however: this unfortunate individual, known only as Uma, seemed to be suffering the effects of a curse that had transformed him into the most hideously ugly and maddeningly stupid being on the planet. Try as he might, Geralt could not communicate with him in this form.<br>

   1053427|00000000||They say chess is the game of kings, and Radovid proved this point twice over during his meeting with Geralt. First, by playing the royal game at the Oxenfurt Chess Club while they met, and then by treating Geralt like a pawn he could send out to do his bidding. His requested move? Witcher takes sorceress: his spies had reported finding signs of Philippa Eilhart's presence in the elven ruins outside of Novigrad. Geralt was to go there and retrieve her. Normally Geralt resisted attempts to command him around the board, but he owed Radovid a favor - and had his own reasons for wanting to find Philippa...<br>
   1053428|00000000||Geralt found and searched Philippa's hideout. Though there were signs of her presence everywhere, the sorceress herself was long gone.<br><br>She had, however, left one thing behind that could prove of great value - a damaged crystal from her megascope. The witcher knew such a gem could, if properly probed, reveal priceless information about her doings. He thus was faced with a choice - should he give the crystal to Radovid, or take it to one of his sorceress allies?<br>
   1053432|00000000||Geralt took the crystal to Yennefer. A bit of magic and she got it to play back a fragment from the last conversation Philippa had with Margarita Laux-Antille. From it they learned the sorceress, whom Radovid had blinded, was trying to restore her vision, and that both were planning to bring the Lodge of Sorceresses back to life.<br>
   1053433|00000000||Geralt took the crystal to Triss. A bit of magic and she got it to play back a fragment from the last conversation Philippa had with Margarita Laux-Antille. From it they learned the sorceress, whom Radovid had blinded, was trying to restore her vision, and that both were planning to bring the Lodge of Sorceresses back to life.<br>
   1053434|00000000||The witcher decided it would be best if such information never made it to Radovid's ears. He thus decided to leave the crystal with Yennefer.<br>
   1053435|00000000||The witcher decided it would be best if such information never made it to Radovid's ears. He thus decided to leave the crystal with Triss.<br>
   1053448|00000000||Out of a sense of duty, or perhaps a desire to receive at least part of the promised reward, Geralt returned to Radovid to tell him what he had found in Philippa's hideout. The king was clearly not pleased with the outcome of the investigation and dismissed the witcher. As for compensation for his trouble, sadly, the witcher had to go without...<br>
   1053439|00000000||Geralt encountered Radovid's men at the entrance to Philippa's hideout. They demanded the witcher give them the magic crystal, with assurances they would deliver it to the king personally. Geralt reluctantly accepted their offer.<br>
   1053454|00000000||As agreed, Geralt returned to Radovid and gave him the crystal from Philippa's megascope. Though the king was hoping to be handed a sorceress, not a cold, damaged lump of minerals, in the end he appreciated Geralt's effort and paid him his reward.<br>
   1053456|00000000||Although Geralt had given Radovid's men the crystal, he decided to go back to see the king anyway and tell him what he had found in Philippa's hideout. Yet as he had no proof to confirm his words, Radovid refused to give him his reward and sent him away with a sick smirk on his face.
   1087091|00000000||Though Geralt was curious to know what had become of Philippa, wandering around musty and undoubtedly trap-laden elven ruins did not seem like a pleasant way to spend his time. The idea of being the Redanian king's paid hound also did not appeal to him - so he abandoned the task and saw to more interesting and worthy matters instead.
   1087092|00000000||The witcher hesitated a long time before deciding what to do with the crystal - so long, in fact, that he forgot about it entirely. He never did learn what mysteries that damaged piece of megascope contained.

    455895|00000000||Should a soldier be held responsible for the decisions of his commanding officers? Is collective responsibility justice? To us, dear reader, these are rhetorical questions. Geralt, however, often found himself forced to answer them - and quickly. For example, once in Velen he happened across a group of villagers preparing to lynch a captured Nilfgaardian deserter. Not for the first time, the witcher had to decide which was the lesser evil...<br>
   1065293|00000000||The witcher made his decision. He defended the deserter and earned the peasants' ire. They attacked at once, and thus in order to save one man he had to kill many others.
   1065294|00000000||The witcher made his decision. So that many could live, he agreed to allow the death of one. He knew that, if he defended the Nilfgaardian, he would be forced to slaughter the entire crowd of enraged peasants and so merely shook his head and walked on.

   1055648|00000000||Vesemir told Geralt that Yennefer had set up her trusty megascope as soon as she arrived at Kaer Morhen, but could not get it to function for the life of her. This news greatly troubled the witcher. If Yennefer was planning to use her megascope, that meant a conversation with other sorceresses was in the works - and that in turn meant scheming, politics and other things Geralt truly could not stand.<br>
   1055649|00000000||As expected, Yennefer did not extend Geralt the warmest of greetings. Nevertheless, Geralt, ever the noble and patient soul, helped the sorceress eliminate the source of the magical disturbance. It turned out the culprit was a case of dimeritium bombs Lambert had carelessly placed near the sorceress' room. Tsk, tsk, Lambert.
    168988|00000000||Let Yennefer know you removed the source of the disturbance.

Or troll boom man head.</i><br>– rock troll dwelling in a cave on Undvik<br><br>If while hiking high in the mountains you come across a walking stone, do not think your eyes deceive you. Instead, draw your sword – for before you stands a rock troll. True, not every encounter with these creatures ends in a fight - while not particularly intelligent, trolls are capable of reason – but it is better to prepare for the worst. Otherwise, your hike might end not on the summit, but in their stew.<br>
   1077867|00000000||Trolls are able to use fire and simple tools, and some of them have even mastered the basics of Common Speech. Though linguistic nuances such as conjugations and declinations escape them, they are extremely fond of riddles, rhymes and all sorts of wordplay, a fact a witcher in possession of a bit of wit can use to his advantage.<br><br>If a fight proves inevitable, one must watch out for the stones these trolls throw with great strength and shocking precision. Their powerful, heavy fists also present a danger, for they can buckle even the sturdiest breastplate or cuirass. Since their backs are covered in a layer of rocky growth, blows delivered from behind will not do them much damage. They must thus be fought directly, standing face to face – and preferably armed with a sword covered in a fresh coating of ogroid oil.

   1053771|00000000||Geralt ran into a suspicious gentleman who was looking for a woman who spoke in a strange, unknown tongue. He claimed they came from some far-off land far beyond the sea. She had kidnapped a child, and he had been tasked with finding and punishing her.<br>
   1053786|00000000||Geralt showed the shady gentleman the place where the woman was hiding then let him do as he wished. He had no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of a far-off and unknown country.<br>
   1053787|00000000||Geralt showed the shady gentleman where the woman was hiding, but did not let him hurt her. The story the man had told him seemed stretched and unlikely. Geralt defeated the fraud, and, unable to communicate with the woman, gave her a letter he had found on a corpse near the cave.<br>
   1077555|00000000||On a small isle in Skellige Geralt found a diary written by refugees from a far-off land. Their ship had wrecked and the fate of its passengers was unknown. Geralt hoped at least some had survived and he would one day have the chance to return this diary to them.<br>
   1077556|00000000||On Velen's seashore Geralt came across a the wreck of a ship. While looking the vessel over he noticed an unusual emblem - the same he had seen on a similar wreck in Skellige. As was the case then, he found no signs of any survivors.<br>

    363564|00000000||Went around, through town. Didn't want to come back via the sewers… Rather avoid pops, even with the antidote in my system.
    381784|00000000||I'm done investigating.
    381786|00000000||Done. Examined every nook of the sewers near your vault.
    320686|00000000||Go to the bathhouse with Triss.
    533488|00000000||Go to the fountain near the Passiflora.
    533489|00000000||Look for Philippa in the bathhouse.
    533491|00000000||Catch Philippa Eilhart.
    533492|00000000||Sneak up on Philippa without making too much noise.
   1048551|00000000||Talk to Triss Merigold.
   1048603|00000000||Triss returned to Novigrad after leaving Kaer Morhen with one goal - to find Philippa Eilhart. Soon after she made a shocking discovery - Philippa had been right under our very noses the whole time! Turned into an owl by some malicious spell, she then wound up in the hands of Zoltan, who, ignorant of his new pet's true identity, strived to make of her a replacement for his former foul-mouthed parrot companion, Field Marshal Duda.<br><br>Triss was not the only one to uncover Philippa's whereabouts, however. Coming to that conclusion slightly before her was Dijkstra, who shared with Philippa with the strongest bond possible - love turned to seething hate. The one-time spy and current mafia boss had captured Philippa and imprisoned her in his bathhouse. Triss and Geralt knew they must hurry - it was clear Dijkstra had not gone through all this trouble to chat with Philippa about old times. Vengeance was more likely on his agenda, vengeance for breaking his heart and daring to plot against him.<br>
   1048604|00000000||It is frightening to think how this story might have ended had Triss and Geralt not arrived at the bathhouse in the nick of time. A dimeritium collar had kept Philippa trapped in owl form, but somehow she had managed to free herself from it, revert to her true self, overcome her guards and start tearing the bathhouse apart. Dodging her furious blasts, Geralt was finally able to corner her and convince her he and Triss did not want to harm her - in fact, they needed her help. Though Dijkstra was vehemently opposed to letting the sorceress go, he ultimately realized resistance was futile in the face of Geralt's ironclad logic. And so Philippa Eilhart regained her freedom and joined the offensive against Eredin and his Red Riders.<br>

   1077716|00000000||<i>Ulfhedinn? What's that, some kind of fish?</i><br>– Professor Artibus Joannes Rack, geographer, disappeared during a surveying expedition in Skellige<br><br>Ulfhedinn are a breed of werewolf found mainly in Skellige. The harsh and barren conditions of the isles might explain why they primarily hunt men and are stronger than their Continental brethren. Older and particularly dangerous ulfhedinn are called vorefs. Only a few daring warriors in all of Skellige history have managed to defeat an ulfhedinn, and each of them is commemorated in ballads as a hero to this day.<br>
   1077717|00000000||Like werewolves, ulfhedinn and vorefs are active at night, particularly when the moon is at its fullest. Fast, strong and amazingly resilient, these creatures kill with disturbing ease. Silver blades should be brought against them, as should Devil's Puffball. Take note that when near death an ulfhedinn becomes particularly dangerous and will attack with doubled fury, while calling on wolves to come to its rescue.

   1077733|00000000||I've had enough. My father and brother think I'm nothing. All they do's laugh at me, they're always laughing. Saying my face is fair as a maid's, and I'm only fit for lying in bed with maids and certainly not for battling with men. And one day one of those cuckolded husbands is going to break my neck... True, never have had much problem securing ladies' affections, but that's not something I asked for...<br><br>Marie wouldn't let me leave her bedchamber, so we dallied on till her husband, Noorhis Ironsides, and his mates came back with their lootings. I jumped into a wardrobe and stayed to listen, though it was uncomfortable as all get out. They said they'd sunk some great treasure ship by the rocks between Faroe and Ard Skellig, and that come morning they intended to go fish it out. Once they'd drunk themselves to sleep, I slipped out of the wardrobe and told Marie we should slit all their throats, get that treasure ourselves and leave these horrible isles, go somewhere better - Kovir, or even Novigrad!<br><br>Marie didn't take long to convince, because her husband was a true whoreson and beat her terribly, so Noorhis and his mates are bits in a fish's guts by now, and I'm off to find my fortune.<br><br>Who cares that I'm not too skilled a sailor and a storm's coming? I'll be done and gone before hit hits!<br>
   1077734|00000000||Apparently, when Geralt found a letter mentioning treasure once belonging to mysterious man named Ironsides, he suspected it to be a fragment from one of my more outlandish ballads.

Werewolves, though – they're every bit as bad and worse.</i><br>– Elsa Vilge, archer <br><br>Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside of them. When in beastly form, they take the worst traits from each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's condition comes about as the result of a curse and the transformations happen outside his conscious control. When he returns to human form, he has no memory of his deeds – otherwise he would surely go mad or take his own life.<br>
   1077714|00000000||Werewolves are active at night, particularly when the moon is full. Though they hunt alone, when threatened they will summon wolves to aid them. Werewolves rarely feel the need to flee, for few adversaries put up much of a fight against them. They strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors and regenerate any damage received in mere moments. When fighting werewolves a witcher should wield a blade covered in oil harmful to the cursed and have a large supply of Devil's Puffballs handy.<br><br>A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must therefore equip himself with a great deal of patience – and sturdy armor.

   1053466|00000000||While traversing the outskirts of Novigrad, Geralt happened across a contract on a creature known as the Apiarian Phantom. It had been hung by a certain Holofernes Meiersdorf, owner of the Honeyfill beekeeping plantation. Geralt decided to pursue the bounty.<br>
   1053468|00000000||While traversing the outskirts of Novigrad, Geralt came cross tracks which did not resemble those of any creature he knew from his world. His witcher instincts buzzing, he decided to investigate what had left them.<br>
   1053467|00000000||While traversing the outskirts of Novigrad, Geralt came across a beekeeping plantation called Honeyfill tucked amidst some flowering meadows and fields. The owner of these lands, a halfling named Holofernes Meiersdorf, told Geralt that his apiary had been haunted for some time by the Apiarian Phantom, a wraith which kills the bees and destroys the hives of wayward beekeepers. Geralt decided to look into the matter.<br>
   1053469|00000000||Geralt's investigation revealed the monster was hiding in the basement of an unfinished home near the Meiersdorf estate. What Geralt had to do was clear: enter the basement and kill the beast.<br>
   1053470|00000000||Once Geralt had forced his way in, he was greeted to an unexpected sight: the house's interior was completely frozen, and standing amidst the frost - a giant and terrifying creature Geralt knew to be one of the Wild Hunt's hounds. The beast put up quite the fight, but in the end Geralt proved stronger and bested his opponent. When he showed the beekeeper the trophy he had taken from the hound, he received a handsome reward.<br>

The monster quickly realized it was outmatched and fled to hide in the surrounding fields, and Geralt was unable to track it down. Even though he had not fully finished his task, he returned to his employer.

   1061083|00000000||Geralt could not help but notice that Udalryk did seem to be acting strangely, muttering to himself often and showing signs of suppressed panic, as if he lived in constant fear of something - or someone.<br>

   1051878|00000000||As you are, no doubt, already well aware, Geralt has always paid particular interest to crowns and the men who wear them. Kings, you see, are always in need of specialists to perform dirty jobs for them. When Geralt heard King Radovid wanted to see him, he surmised this was just such a moment and set off in the hope a profitable witcher contract was in the offing.<br>
   1051879|00000000||And this time Geralt was not mistaken. Radovid asked him to track down and bring back Philippa Eilhart, a sorceress Radovid hated with a particular fury.
   1051875|00000000||Go see King Radovid.

   1077736|00000000||<i>Lazy, good-for-nothing men are sometimes called drones. That's an insult to endrega drones, who at least get off their arses to fight.</i><br>– Evelynn Harker, herbalist <br><br>Endrega males – called ‘drones' – are gluttonous creatures whose only aim in life is to eat, fight and reproduce. Yet when venturing outside their nests, these aggressive hunters attack any and every creature they come across.<br>
   1077737|00000000||Endrega drones live but brief lives, the culmination of which comes in the autumn when they fertilize the queen. They pass the time leading to that moment protecting the colony's territory. Weaker drones die in these battles, while the largest and strongest survive. These elect individuals' genes are passed down to the next generation of endregas, while they themselves are killed after fertilization takes place and their bodies used to feed the hive during the long winter months.<br><br>Drones are easy to identify thanks to their distinctive, cone-shaped abdomens. Unlike other endregas they can attack from a distance, sending out volleys of poisoned quills. As with all of their kind, bleeding has no effect on them and insectoid oil does them great harm.

   1048605|00000000||When it comes to matters of the heart, my friend the witcher was never one of the most decisive men in the world. That is why, when he unexpectedly found both Triss and Yennefer back in his life, he couldn't unravel the conundrum of which to choose and... led both to believe they were his one and only. Usually such stupidity ends in bitter words and tossed cutlery - but not this time.<br><br>When the three of them were alone, the sorceresses revealed to Geralt that they knew what he had done and... were fine it. They had concluded that they all cared about each other deeply, and fighting their instincts would defy nature's wishes. They had a special start planned for this new chapter in their lives - a romantic evening for just the three of them at the Kingfisher.
   1048606|00000000||"Don't keep two irons in the fire (especially if by 'irons' we mean sorceresses, and by 'keep in the fire' we mean 'simultaneously profess your love to both')" - an awkward motto, true, but Geralt of Rivia would have been wise to adopt it. Triss and Yennefer punished the two-timing witcher with admirable ingenuity and wit. I must admit I also played a hand in the prank - well, perhaps only a pinky finger, but still, my small role gave me tremendous satisfaction. To save Geralt from the revenge of wronged lovers - I could not help but savor such a magnificent turning of the tables.

    397137|00000000||While riding through the village nestled at the base of Kaer Trolde, Geralt spotted a notice posted by a certain Odhen of Rannvaig promising a bounty for information about his missing son. It seemed like a job for a witcher, and since Geralt was, as usual, hard up for coin, he decided to look into it.<br>
    397138|00000000||As Geralt passed through the village of Rannvaig, a man by the name of Odhen stopped him and asked for help in finding his missing son. The witcher, hearing honest fatherly despair in the man's voice and, no less importantly, feeling the lightness of his own purse, decided to look into the matter.<br>
    397139|00000000||Geralt tracked down and killed the fiend - avenging the death of Odhen's son and making sure no more Skelligers would share the boy's fate.<br>
   1051013|00000000||It turned out that Odhen's son and his friends had not just gone missing, but had been murdered, torn to pieces by a fiend. Geralt arrived too late to save the boys - but just in time to face the beast who had killed them. Sensing that it stood no chance in this fight, the beast fled - but there's no hiding from a witcher...<br>
   1086618|00000000||The restless soul that he is, Geralt is incapable of remaining stationary for long. Things were no different on Ard Skellig. While galavanting about the isle, Geralt happened on a fiend. Unlucky beast, for the witcher sliced it into ribbons. As it turned out, the fiend had done some shredding of its own prior to its demise. One of its recent victims - a young man who proved to be the offpsring of one Odhen from the village of Rannvaig. Odhen had been seeking his son for some time - alas, it need be said, fruitlessly.

   1051280|00000000||The Redanian army had placed blockades on the crossings of the Pontar, something which at one point proved quite inconvenient to the witcher. The guards refused to let him cross without showing a special pass issued by high command.<br>
   1051281|00000000||Luckily Geralt managed to get his hands on just such a pass and from then on could cross the Pontar border at will. I hope he did not abuse this privilege, jumping back and forth across the border, making faces at the poor wretches stuck on one side and taunting the guards who had no right to stop his antics. He mentioned nothing of the sort, true, but that's just the kind of thing one might choose to keep to oneself.

   1082147|00000000||<i>Your package? Your brother picked it up. You know, you two're damn near identical... Hey! Where you running off to?!</i><br>– Hanne Kluger, postmaster<br><br>Dopplers, also known as vexlings or changelings, are beings able to take on the form of any humanoid or animal they please. This transformation is no mere illusion able to be shattered with a simple spell, but an authentic and complete metamorphosis. This means no protective amulets or witcher medallions will signal a doppler's presence - they emanate the same aura as the being whose form they have assumed. This, combined with their incredible intellect and cunning, would make dopplers supreme assassins or thieves - had not nature endowed them with generous and timid spirits which make them avoid the shedding of blood at all costs.
   1082148|00000000||When backed into a corner, dopplers can present a grave danger by taking on the form of their assailant - and along with it his strengths and abilities. The sum result is to force the assailant to battle against himself - a battle few can win.<br><br>Like other relicts, dopplers are extremely vulnerable to silver, and so a silver sword should be used when fighting them. Silver has the additional useful property of forcing a doppler to change form on contact.

   1061645|00000000||The youngest among the witchers of Kaer Morhen, and perhaps the last ever trained within its walls, by the start of our tale Lambert had proven his chops many times over, having hunted down many a mighty beast and traversed nearly all the Continent's realms several times over.<br><br>Yet he had also developed a reputation for arrogance and sardonic humor, and his gruff and at times excessively blunt manner could irritate even his fellow witchers of the School of the Wolf. Whatever his vices, it went without saying that Lambert would brave the fires of any hell for his companions.<br>
   1061646|00000000||If destiny truly chooses which boys become witchers, then in Lambert’s case it had made a twisted, cruel choice. After hearing his story, Geralt had to admit that Lambert had every reason to be unenthused about the lot fate had granted him.<br>
   1061647|00000000||A chance encounter of two witchers hunting the same ekimmara turned into a tale of old friendship, murder and vengeance. The moral of the story? Don't mess with Lambert.<br>
   1061648|00000000||Though Lambert made no secret of his hatred for Kaer Morhen, when the time came to stand in its defense, he did so without a second thought.<br>
   1061649|00000000||Sadly, during the battle Lambert found himself overwhelmed by enemy forces. Relief came too late and he was cut down by the Wild Hunt's warriors.<br>
   1061650|00000000||During this battle he came within a hair’s breadth of losing his life. Luckily, Geralt arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers.<br>
   1061651|00000000||During this battle, he came within a hair’s breadth of losing his life. Luckily Keira arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers.<br>
   1061652|00000000||It just might be that Lambert and Keira’s later (and somewhat unexpected) relationship came about as a result of that moment, when they fought for survival at each other’s side. It is also possible it was a simple matter of two attractive people taking a liking to each other. At any rate, only time could tell what would become of the couple.<br>

   1053002|00000000||Geralt's travels took him to a certain village whose inhabitants were clearly anxious about something. It turned out they were expecting a gang of bandits led by a woman known as Little Red to attack at any minute. She was out for the blood of a certain Bertram who she claimed had wronged her. Geralt promised to help defend the villagers.<br>
   1053012|00000000||When Little Red's band attacked, it was clear the villagers had bet on the right horse in hiring Geralt. He made quick work of the cutthroats, collected his reward and went off into the sunset.
   1053020|00000000||When Little Red's band attacked, it became clear the matter was not at all as clear as it had at first seemed. The bandits' leader assured Geralt she did not want to hurt anyone except for this Bertram. The man had worked with her at one point as an informer pointing out who was worth robbing, but then turned and reported them to the authorities.<br><br>Faced with the choice of killing several people or letting one guilty man be punished, Geralt decided to let Little Red have her revenge. For that, he received a reward.

   1061839|00000000||Cyprian Wiley the younger was one of the most dangerous criminals in Novigrad. He had inherited his father's casinos, fighting ring and brothels – and also his sadistic tendencies, ruthlessness and lack of scruples.<br><br>These traits had made the moniker "Whoreson" something of a family heirloom for his powerful criminal clan.<br>
   1061840|00000000||Cyprian also took after his father in terms of ambition. He broke the unwritten armistice in place between Novigrad's various criminal groups and tried to murder the other three leading mafia bosses.<br>
   1061841|00000000||Whoreson's audacity had a very specific cause: King Radovid, who had commissioned the gangster's actions.<br>
   1061842|00000000||It turned out Radovid's plan was for Whoreson to instigate gang warfare in Novigrad so that the resulting chaos would make it easier for him to take control over the city.<br>
   1061843|00000000||While searching Cyprian's home den of iniquity, Geralt discovered the nickname "Whoreson" was in fact an understatement - something much stronger was needed to describe a man who delighted in murdering captive women.<br>
   1061844|00000000||In addition to blackmail, extortion, murder and torture, the list of Whoreson's crimes also included trying to harm Ciri. Geralt took this very personally and made the bandit pay for this last sin with his life.<br>
   1061845|00000000||Though few would have mourned his passing, Geralt decided not to kill Whoreson. As soon as Radovid withdrew his protection and his old enemies were free to exact revenge, Whoreson's career was doomed to an inglorious end.<br>
   1061846|00000000||Whoreson's fate truly did seem worse than death. Abandoned by his protector as well as his subordinates, he had lost all his coin as well as any respect he once commanded, having fallen to the lowest depths of the Novigrad underworld.<br>

   1059652|00000000||The being trapped within Uma's tortured husk turned out to be Avallac'h – a powerful Aen Elle Sage. Geralt had had the pleasure of making his acquaintance years before. Already during these prior encounters Avallac'h displayed an intense, and frankly rather unnerving, interest in the Elder Blood and its bearer, Ciri. His exact motives were unclear at the time, and he made no particular effort to explain them to Geralt.<br><br> Geralt likewise had no idea what bound Ciri and the elf now. There was no doubt Avallac'h had helped her, had saved her numerous times from the Wild Hunt – but why? Alas, no answers to Geralt's burning questions were to be had from the Sage, who quivered on a razor's edge between life and death.<br><br>He did, however, gather the strength to utter a crucial piece of information – Ciri's location.<br>
   1059655|00000000||When Geralt had a chance to talk to Ciri about Avallac'h, he learned that the Sage had been acting as her tutor and mentor for some time. They were bound by a common enemy. Avallac'h had been advisor to the previous ruler of the Aen Elle and had entered into conflict with his successor, Eredin. He had thus made it his mission to protect Ciri from his new king's malicious designs at any cost.<br><br>Ciri made it clearly known that she trusted the Sage, who had saved her life on numerous occasions – including when, feeling the progressing effects of the curse that would transform him into Uma, he decided to hide her form the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists.<br>
   1059666|00000000||Avallac'h played a key role in staving off defeat during the defense of Kaer Morhen. After the battle, he advised the witcher that ultimate victory over Eredin and his ghastly cavalcade would only be possible with magic assistance. That meant Geralt would have to once again pact with members of the infamous Lodge of Sorceresses...<br>
   1059667|00000000||Seizing the calm before the storm, Avallac'h tried once more to teach Ciri to control her incredible talent. He soon found that Ciri was as stubborn a pupil as she was gifted - something that Geralt had discovered for himself much earlier.<br>
   1059669|00000000||Drawing on his knowledge of internal Aen Elle politics and the strengths and weaknesses of the Wild Hunt's commanders, Avallach crafted a plan to eliminate one of Eredin's most powerful allies - his master of manipulation, Ge'els.<br><br>In order to accomplish this, Avallac'h was willing to do anything - even risk a dangerous journey to Tir ná Lia.<br>
   1059676|00000000||Geralt's trip to Avallac'h's laboratory confirmed that the Sage was interested in Ciri and her genealogy.<br>
   1059677|00000000||Based on the notes found in Avallac'h's secret laboratory, it seemed the Sage had been researching Lara Dorren's gene for over two centuries. Clearly the elves were investigating the possibility of producing a child with extraordinary abilities – like those which Ciri possessed.<br>
   1059687|00000000||The elf they stumbled across in Avallac'h's laboratory claimed his interest in Ciri was purely pragmatic and that he secretly loathed her for the human blood in her veins. Was Avallac'h truly so two-faced - or was the mysterious she-elf merely twisting his words to hurt Ciri?<br>
   1059688|00000000||Avallac'h remained shockingly unperturbed when he heard Geralt and his companions had visited his secret laboratory. He openly admitted that he was interested in Lara's bloodline and in protecting her descendants.<br>
   1059691|00000000||When it was suggested that he was more interested in controlling Lara's bloodline and her descendant - namely Ciri - the Sage reacted coldly, curtly dismissing such insinuations.<br>
   1059692|00000000||When they brought up the she-elf they came across in his lab, Avallac'h reacted with mild amusement, as if that particular subject was not worth treating seriously.<br>
   1059695|00000000||The witcher considered the matter and decided Avallac'h could be trusted.<br>
   1059697|00000000||Avallac'h played an active role in the war council preceding the luring of the Wild Hunt into their trap. During these discussions he and Ciri briefly got into a heated argument because Avallac'h firmly insisted she not engage directly in the coming conflict.<br>
   1059708|00000000||Eredin's last words sowed seeds of doubt in Geralt's heart, and Ciri and Avallac'h's sudden disappearance led them to spring into thorny shoots. Everything seemed to indicate that the Sage had been pursuing a hidden goal the whole time – to open the gates between worlds.<br>

   1053413|00000000||While poking around in the forgotten recesses of Kaer Morhen, Geralt happened across an illusory wall. He removed the illusion and behind it found a copy of the tome "Monstrum, or A Portrayal of Witchers." This tract had caused him no end of trouble and he would have tossed it onto the fire at once - if not for the intriguing handwritten note on the first page...<br>
   1053415|00000000||Geralt followed the directions found in the tome's notes and arrived at an old iron mine. After dispatching an earth elemental guardian, he found the tome could be used as a sort of key opening a passageway leading to an old forge. To his great surprise, this forge began speaking to him. Though some might suspect the witcher had merely breathed a bit too much of the musty mine air, he claimed an ifrit, a fire elemental of some kind, had been used ages ago by a mage who created special equipment for the Wolf School witchers. This elemental remained vigilant all these years after the mage's death and thus Geralt had to defeat it in order to get at the secret stash of high-quality gear hidden behind the forge.

   1056256|00000000||It turned out that, while Avallac'h had not been entirely honest with the witcher, he was no traitor. Ciri had slipped off with him during the battle of her volition in order to - and please pardon the grandiosity, dear reader - save the world. She was convinced Geralt would never allow her to embark on this mad endeavor, and so decided she had to operate behind his back. All his promises and threats were for naught - there was no stopping Ciri once she'd made her mind up. The witcher could only watch as she stepped into the elven tower - and hope she would return safe and sound.
   1084951|00000000||Eredin's words rang in Geralt's ears. Could Avallac'h truly have betrayed them? Could Ciri still be in danger, even with the Wild Hunt destroyed once and for all? Without a moment to lose and paying no heed to their wounds or exhaustion, Geralt and Yennefer plunged back into the post-battle chaos ravaging Undvik.

   1072919|00000000||Geralt was not expecting to meet Bernard Ducat, former head of Temerian intelligence, in such circumstances. Their relationship went back a long ways, to the time when Ducat was leading an espionage operation in the Vizima Temple District disguised as a fence named Thaler. Thaler the fence was known for his gruff manners and extremely filthy tongue.<br><br>Much had changed since those days, but Clogs the cobbler (as Ducat now called himself) was as rude and vulgar as Thaler had ever been.<br><br>His exact role in the attack on Radovid was not clear, but considering his experience and professionalism, one could hardly expect him to share that information, not even with an old friend.<br>
   1072932|00000000||Spycraft leaves no margin for error, sentiment or dropping one's guard. Thaler died in a violent bout of political maneuvering when it turned out his plans conflicted with the greater good of Redania.<br>
   1072933|00000000||Spycraft leaves no margin for error, sentiment or dropping one's guard. Thaler should have known this, but instead he left himself exposed and only escaped death thanks to Geralt's intervention, his life saved by the witcher's departure from his usual neutrality.

If so, that time is now long past. The Skelligers whose demolished wagon Geralt stumbled across in the middle of  the Ard Skellig forest learned this the hard way. The poor souls had stood no chance against the cyclops who butchered them.<br>
   1051133|00000000||Geralt searches nearly every corpse he comes across, and while I personally find this habit a bit morbid, I must admit he digs up some very interesting things in the pockets of the dead. This time, for example, he found a letter that he promptly delivered to its addressee - the smith at Kaer Trolde. It was from the smith's departed sister. Though it cast the man into deep mourning, he appreciated Geralt's deed.

   1049221|00000000||Those who stray off the beaten tracks in the bogs of Velen rarely live to amend their error. Even the Nilfgaardian soldiers stationed in the Central Army's camp would at times disappear in the marshes without a trace. After yet another patrol failed to return, the quartermaster of the camp set out a call for some brave soul to search them out and bring them back, or, barring that, at least determine their fate.<br>
   1049222|00000000||Velen might lack for many things, but one it has in great abundance: monsters. Travelers who stray from the trails crossing its bogs and woodlands usually end up butchered by some claw-riddled creature or another. Geralt was thus not particularly surprised when he came across signs of a monster attack in the Velen bush. The call of his witcher duty screeching in his ears, he decided to investigate the matter.<br>
   1076095|00000000||From footprint to muddled footprint, from one broken branch to another, Geralt retraced what had happened in the woods outside the Nilfgaardian camp. Oblivious to the danger, the Nilfgaardian soldiers had strayed into a wyvern's hunting grounds. Their thick plate did not stop the ferocious beast from tearing them to shreds.<br>
   1076096|00000000||Further investigation revealed this already rather gloomy story had an even gloomier twist. They fallen Nilfgaardians had not been wandering the Velen woods on a run-of-the-mill patrol - they had gone there to kill Redanian prisoners of war and hide their bodies. What they did not realize was that the monsters of the swamp could sense the stench of rotting corpses even through thick layers of soil - and never pass up the chance to feed on the dead.<br>
   1076114|00000000||Geralt passed the sad news on to the quartermaster and collected his bounty. The Nilfgaardians' love for order and organization might not make them very good lovers, but it does make them excellent paymasters.<br>
   1076115|00000000||The Nilfgaardian quartermaster brushed off Geralt's accusations of war crimes with a shrug of his shoulders. The witcher was disgusted by this response, but felt outbursts of indignation would not do much to change the course of the conflict, whereas a purse of gold would do a great deal to change his material circumstances. He thus took his pay and marched straight out of camp.
   1076116|00000000||The Nilfgaardian quartermaster brushed off Geralt's accusations of war crimes with a shrug of his shoulders. Though the witcher had most certainly earned his pay and needed the coin, he refused to accept the quartermaster's gold. Even a hired monster slayer has his principles.

   1055877|00000000||Geralt was far from the only person in White Orchard looking for a lost loved one. War had divided many families, including that of a certain villager whose brother went missing after the last big battle. Geralt was short on time but still agreed to help. You're surprised, dear reader - but you shouldn't be. The witcher might seem grumpy at times and downright cynical at others, but he rarely passes by another man's misfortune without seeing what he can do to help.<br>
   1055878|00000000||Geralt and Dune began their search where the missing man had last been seen: the battlefield. Yet while the witcher started the investigation, a mutt named Hussar who finished it for him. When the dog caught its owner's scent, it raced off, following the trail while barking its brains out and not caring one whit if Dune or Geralt were following after.<br>
   1055879|00000000||Geralt went about finding Yennefer methodically. He searched every inch of every field and dale near White Orchard. Though in the end it was not this searching that led to his reunion with the sorceress, it did lead another interesting discovery. He came across two wounded soldiers in a hut near the battlefield - one from Nilfgaard, the other Temerian. It turned out they had fled the field of battle together. Though they lived their in enviable harmony and confraternity, they warriors could not remain in the hideout permanently -- they needed food and a medic's help. The Temerian thus asked Geralt to put them in contact with his brother, Dune, who might be able to help.<br>
   1055880|00000000||It turned out the missing brother had been heavily wounded but had survived the battle nonetheless… saved by a Nilfgaardian deserter.<br>
   1055881|00000000||Sadly Dune did not return the Nilfgaardian's favor. Afraid for his own life, he decided to leave the man to a certain death.<br>
   1055882|00000000||Though reluctant, Dune agreed to return the Nilfgaardian's favor. He took the foreigner in under his roof, thus saving him from certain death.<br>
   1055883|00000000||Geralt found the wounded soldier's brother and conveyed the good news. This deed saved a man's life - and earned Geralt a few coppers.<br>
   1086611|00000000||As it turned out, Geralt was not alone in searchig White Orchard for a lost loved one. The witcher also found the notice of a peasant who was seeking his brother. The brother had left home to take up arms against Nilfgaard. The forces of the North and the Black Ones had then clashed in a great battle near the brothers' home village, and the peasant had not heard from his brother since.
   1086612|00000000||Though pressed for time, Geralt decided to find Dune Vildenvert and then agreed to help the man. Be not puzzled, dear reader, for though the witcher oft appeared a surly scoffer, deep inside he was a sensitive soul, unwilling to look upon human grief and dismiss it.<br>
   1017405|00000000||Using your Witcher Senses, search for Temerian shields with small white flowers painted on them.

    486460|00000000||What about you? Any beef with Dandelion?
    486479|00000000||You wouldn't happen to have a bone to pick with Dandelion, would you?
    486480|00000000||Course I do.
    486481|00000000||You serious?
    486483|00000000||Dead serious… Dandelion published a sonnet recently. Second stanza - the shit uses paired couplets instead of an inserted rhyme! Surely you understand how deeply offended the poetry lover in me was. The bastard shan't get away with it!
    486485|00000000||I was being serious.
    486487|00000000||As am I when I say I have exactly no time to worry about your gigolo boyfriend. Got my own problems…
    486541|00000000||Problems you might be able to help me with.
    379777|00000000||What'd you need help with?
    366115|00000000||So what am I supposed to help you with?
    383258|00000000||You were gonna show me something.
    383255|00000000||You were gonna show me something.
    383257|00000000||Mhm. And you were going to follow. Come on - no mucking around this time, understood?
    363065|00000000||I'd rather show than tell. Picture's worth a thousand words and all that tripe. Ah, and you do realize if you say anything about what you see here to anyone, it'll mean a razor between your ribs?
    378412|00000000||Figured as much.
    378414|00000000||Excellent. One last request… Oh, let's call it what it is - a command. Don't draw your sword unless I ask you to.
    486545|00000000||Maybe I can help… What do you need?
    363059|00000000||Maybe I can help… Whaddaya need?
    421836|00000000||Don't have time right now.
    421838|00000000||Then come back when you do.
    421834|00000000||Don't have the time just now.
    363061|00000000||You'll pay me on top of that, right?
    486547|00000000||I'll get paid on top of that, right?
    486549|00000000||Nothing for free, eh? Did you bargain this hard when Emhyr wanted to hire you?
    420606|00000000||Who told you?
    420608|00000000||What do you mean "who"? Emhyr did.
    425017|00000000||Hahah.
    425019|00000000||I could never reveal my sources, to you or anyone else. It would be fucking unprofessional.
    420600|00000000||Who told you?
    420598|00000000||Don't know what you're talking about.
    420602|00000000||No idea what you're talking about.
    420604|00000000||You are the worst liar I've ever known… Glad I don't need you to win a poker game for me.
    420610|00000000||But we've chatted enough. Yeah, I'll pay you - count on it. So, can I count on you?
   1059632|00000000||And if you did, why then I might be inclined to ask after Dandelion, establish what happened to him.
    486462|00000000||Seem a bit prickly… Something bothering you?
    486464|00000000||Sorry, I know I've been unbearable lately. But at my age, the menopause, what with hot flashes and violent mood swings…
    486466|00000000||Dijkstra, men don't get menopause. You know that, don't you?
    486468|00000000||Yes, you moron. I also know you don't actually give a shite about my problems. What do you want?
    486469|00000000||You got me… Need work, thought you might throw some my way. Monster trouble, that sort of thing.
    486543|00000000||Yeah… Might be able to help me, in fact.
    486459|00000000||Why so irritable?
    423358|00000000||Know what happened to Dandelion?
    423008|00000000||Listen - Dandelion's missing. Any idea what might've happened to him?
    424983|00000000||Same thing that happens to anyone who steps on Junior's toes…
    486449|00000000||Meaning?
    486451|00000000||He's surrounded by splendid virgins who ply him with sparkling wine and pastries stuffed with nightingales' tongues.
    486454|00000000||Come, Geralt, what do you think's happened to him? I reckon he's at the bottom of the Pontar, trussed up with the strings of his own mandolin.
    486456|00000000||Lute.
    486458|00000000||Far as I'm concerned he might as well be rotting down there with a goddamn trombone.

   1061150|00000000||During the Crones' sabbath it turned out the sisters truly did feed on human flesh, cooking them up in infernal pots spiced with root from the cursed tree growing on Bald Mountain.<br>

   1077609|00000000||<i>Course it reeks. Think they're called rotfiends because they smell like roses?</i><br>– Vesemir, witcher of the Wolf School<br><br>Rotfiends resemble decomposing human bodies that have been stripped of their skin. Their presence is given away by the overwhelming stench of the rot which gives them their name. Devourers are a particularly dangerous kind of rotfiend marked by an insatiable appetite for human flesh.<br>
   1077610|00000000||Rotfiends and devourers were once rarities, but in the present age of constant warfare and violence they have become a veritable plague, particularly around battlefields and in disease-stricken areas. Though they feed mainly on carrion, they will at times attack the living. They usually feed in large groups and thus present a danger to lone travelers – especially considering their speed, which is more than a match for a horse at full gallop.<br><br>The rotfiend's decomposing body is filled with gasses which are poisonous even to those who, like witchers, are immune to most other toxins. These emissions are also highly flammable, meaning any spark, not to mention a carelessly-cast Igni sign, can lead to an explosion. This is particularly likely after a rotfiend dies, when its body thrashes around in uncontrollable tremors.<br><br>Rotfiends and devourers feed in the twilight hours and at night, when they become much more dangerous than during the day.

    591949|00000000||Perish!
    591995|00000000||Run for your lives!
    513378|00000000||Mentioned you wanted something from me.
    513379|00000000||I did. And still do. The cursed isle on Lake Wyndamer - you've heard of it, I'm sure.
    521130|00000000||The local peasants mumble incessantly about it, about the wraiths that haunt it. They claim none who go there return.
    520640|00000000||I managed to. But while on the island, I did sense something strange. How'd it come to be cursed?
    520618|00000000||How'd it come to be cursed?
    520642|00000000||That's what I don't know! I must break this spell, yet I've been unable to identify its source.
    520761|00000000||Gotta know something…
    520763|00000000||Scraps. The curse is somehow linked to the tower where Vserad, the lord of these lands, took refuge when Nilfgaard invaded.
    520765|00000000||Claims in the village are that peasants, desperate of hunger, sailed to Fyke Isle to beg for food. Met their end there, it was a massacre.
    520885|00000000||So, will you please help me lift this curse? You're so good at these things.
    520994|00000000||Oh, go already. I can't wait to see what you discover on Fyke Isle. Just be sure to come and see me afterwards. And… Geralt?
    520996|00000000||Hm?
    520998|00000000||Thank you.
    520990|00000000||I need to know anything else before I go?
    520992|00000000||No. That is all.
    520970|00000000||I'm off to Fyke Isle.
    521000|00000000||So, where'd you get the xenovox?
    521002|00000000||Found it in the mine, along with the lamp.
    521004|00000000||Thought it was part of the lamp at first. Didn't realize what I'd actually found until later.
    521006|00000000||Think it belonged to the elven mage?
    521008|00000000||Clearly. And I didn't even know the elves used them.
    520974|00000000||Where'd you get the xenovox?
    520972|00000000||Xenovox - never heard of that.
    520976|00000000||Never heard of a xenovox.
    520978|00000000||It works just like a megascope, but is far more portable.
    520980|00000000||Think of it as a magic box that talks.
    520982|00000000||They hard to build?
    520984|00000000||Extremely. That's why they're so rare. I certainly couldn't build anything like it.
    520986|00000000||So, no chance these xenovoxes'll catch on, with every mage using one?
    520988|00000000||Not the slightest.
    520932|00000000||How's the lamp actually work? I mean, do I just rub it or do I have to do something, uh, magical?
    520934|00000000||You needn't even rub. Just place it where you find bones and hear whispers. Ehm… I suppose I should warn you - it might not be the most pleasant experience.
    520936|00000000||Figured as much. Tell you all about it later, maybe skip the drastic bits.
    520938|00000000||You'll need to do neither. I'll give you a xenovox. It's a bauble that will let us speak over some distance.
    520940|00000000||You will tell me what you see, and I shall tell you what to do and look for.
    520942|00000000||The magic lamp - how's it work?
    521166|00000000||Why won't you go with me?
    521167|00000000||Can't you just come with me?
    521284|00000000||I tried to go to Fyke Isle once. Thought my head would burst, the curse's magic was so strong.
    521286|00000000||Nice of you to send me there.
    521290|00000000||I experienced an acute nasal hemorrhage. You stand to endure a wobble of your medallion at most.
    521313|00000000||At Aretuza they trained me to detect even the subtlest magic pulses. This was like getting smacked across my haunches with a grain flail.
    521315|00000000||Funny, thought you'd go in for that sort of thing.
    521300|00000000||Take my boat. I left it on the lake shore, near the village. Should be fit to use.
    521302|00000000||Provided rot hasn't eaten it, as it seems to eat everything here.
    521053|00000000||All right. I'll help.
    520960|00000000||I knew you'd find it irresistible! Naturally, you'll need to sail to Fyke Isle.
    520962|00000000||Fine. What then?
    520964|00000000||Well, the spirits who wander the isle - you must establish a rapport with them, don't know how. But they could point us in the direction of the curse's source.
    520966|00000000||Think they'll be willing to chat?
    520968|00000000||Of course, provided you take my magic lamp with you.
    521199|00000000||I shall let you keep it afterwards, in appreciation. You'll find it quite useful, I'm sure.
    513388|00000000||I'll help you.
    437180|00000000||So the peasants who went to the island for food - this lord had them murdered?
    437186|00000000||The villagers say he had them poisoned.
    446924|00000000||A real gentleman.
    446926|00000000||Hm… I never met him, but he certainly didn't seem such a cruel man judging by what a mage from the isle told me.
    448846|00000000||A mage lived on the island? Did you know him? Where is he now?
    447499|00000000||We were friends. Sadly, he died that day as well. Very few survived.
    446940|00000000||Yet even those who escaped the isle soon suffered agonizing deaths. Strangely, they did not seem to have been poisoned.
    521023|00000000||Vserad had all the peasants killed?
    513500|00000000||Need to think about it.
    513501|00000000||Not too long, I trust. If you've any questions--
    520786|00000000||…I'll know where to find you.
    520788|00000000||Ughh…
    513389|00000000||Lemme think about it.
    520684|00000000||Why do you want to lift the curse?
    520716|00000000||Why're you so intent on this?
    520718|00000000||I'm not, the local peasantry is. "The isle, miss! You've got to lift the charm! You're a good witch, a great witch!" There's no end to it.
    520720|00000000||Uh-huh. See, I thought you didn't care for the locals. The great witch you are…
    520722|00000000||I fail to lift the curse and they could conclude I'm not so great, not enough to conceal me from the witch hunters and risk getting sent to the gallows themselves.
    520770|00000000||What others think, your image - that's all you care about.
    520724|00000000||The point is… Listen, I didn't flee to these wilds just to stupidly get caught because some boor with grit under his fingernails grows annoyed with me.
    513508|00000000||This island that's cursed…
    513509|00000000||Prepared to help after all?
    513377|00000000||Said you had a request for me.
   1084764|00000000||Swimming
   1078489|00000000||You gotta give up this madness, Morgen. Mum's beside herself, saying that's not becoming of a Temerian, stealing from innocent folk. Bad enough you deserting the army like that, but to take to robbing...  And how're you even sure you aren't hurting our own by accident? What happens if you and your mates make a mistake? You ever think about that? No, you didn't, ever since you were a lad you always acted first, thought later - or never. But you ain't a lad no more, so put an end to this reckless adventure and head home.<br>
   1078490|00000000||Geralt found the camp, but the deserters refused to surrender their treasure without a fight. They attacked the witcher at once - which proved a fatal error. Geralt vanquished them without much trouble, searched the camp and found a sizeable cache of valuables.
   1087015|00000000||During his stay in White Orchard, a certain letter found its way into Geralt's possession. Intrigued by its appearance, he decided to read it first chance he got.

   1081896|00000000||<br>That is exactly the perplexing question faced by Geralt of Rivia. In the end he believed Salma and decided to let her go free - though he could not shake off the feeling that he might live to regret that decision.
   1083317|00000000||<br>That is exactly the perplexing question faced by Geralt of Rivia. The succubus Salma claimed she killed out of necessity, that she had had no other choice. While the witcher did have another choice, he chose not to exercise it and killed the succubus instead - figuring this would be the lesser evil.
   1086973|00000000||The witcher's investigation uncovered that a succubus named Salma was responsible for the string of killings afflicting the Novigrad city guard. This came as a surprise, for succubi do not usually commit premeditated, cold-blooded murder. This is not to say they are not dangerous: they will at times kill on accident, when carried away on a particularly gushing stream of ecstasy. At other times, they kill in self-defense: though they have the look of slender maids from the waist up, their supple limbs hide incredible strength. They are also invulnerable to fire, the Igni Sign included. They present witchers with an intractable dilemma: does this monster, who wishes men no ill yet all the same often causes harm, deserve death, or mercy?
   1087322|00000000||<i>I'm not one to lie. Nor do I kill without a reason.</i><br>– Salma, succubus<br>

    472591|00000000||The old woman looked much like the many other widows of Velen, though her eyes seemed to have seen even more hardship than usual. Perhaps that was because she was haunted by the ghost of her husband, who had died at war years ago. The ghost had asked the woman to bring her wedding ring to his grave. The cemetery was too far-off for an elderly woman to journey to, however, so she asked Geralt if he could make the trip for her. The witcher took pity and decided to grant her this somewhat unusual request.<br>
   1051208|00000000||Geralt took the old woman's ring to her husband's grave. Yet when he returned for his reward, she was nowhere to be found. Her did find her granddaughter, who informed him her grandmother had died years earlier and paid him for his trouble.

   1077514|00000000||<i>Aye, half-eagle, half-tomcat, just like on the lord’s crest. ‘Cept this 'un was carryin’ me dead cow ‘stead of a scepter.</i><br>– Griffin attack witness, name unknown<br><br>Griffins were once only found high in the mountains, where they would hunt marmots and wild goats. When humans encroached on their lands, however, griffins soon discovered a new source of much more plentiful and easier-caught prey: cows, sheep and shepherds. Though still wary of main roads and towns (where folk with the means to higher a witcher are like to dwell), these half-eagle, half-wildcat creatures have gone from rarities to oft-encountered pests known throughout the Northern Realms.  Especially hated are the subspecies known as royal griffins and archgriffins.<br>
   1077515|00000000||Griffins mate for life and when their partner is attacked they will defend it to the death. For this reason they are often considered the embodiment of courage, loyalty and fighting spirit. This last attribute no one would deny them – when provoked, they will not cease their attack until they have torn their opponent to shreds. <br><br>Griffins find their victims using their extraordinarily perceptive sense of smell. After drawing near to their chosen target they attack by swooping down from great height. Their muscular mass combined with their swift speed mean this blow alone is often enough to end the fight. If, however, the victim survives this aerial assault, the griffin will immediately engage it in direct combat, making use of its sharp, curved beak and powerful talons.<br><br>The wounds it deals are deep and cause powerful bleeding. Even worse, griffins do not have any true weaknesses – except for their vulnerability to hybrid oil and certain kinds of bombs.

   1073374|00000000||This list shows your current objectives.
   1049674|00000000||The notes left by Hendrik, the Nilfgaardian agent, mentioned that Ciri had quarreled with some witch, and that the newt-stewer in question could be found near the village of Midcopse. Exactly where, Geralt did not know - and so he was forced to swallow his manly pride and ask the locals for directions.<br>
   1049679|00000000||The peasants of Midcopse were not overly talkative, but in the end Geralt managed to get enough hints out of them to find the witch's hut.<br>
   1049695|00000000||It turned out the witch Ciri had conflicted with might have been Keira Metz, who was living near Midcopse disguised as a village witch. Geralt had visited her before - but now he had to return to her isolated hut to ask about his ward.<br>
   1049696|00000000||Unfortunately, Keira had not actually encountered Ciri, and the witch mentioned in Hendrik's notes was nowhere to be found. Geralt's efforts were not entirely in vain, however. The sorceress had recently entertained an unexpected guest - a masked elven mage. This mysterious visitor was, like Geralt, interested in Ciri's whereabouts. Keira figured the mage would be where she had left him and set off with Geralt towards his hideout.

   1002608|00000000||When the devil cannot go himself, he sends a woman - and when a sorceress is indisposed, she sends a witcher to do her errands. That, at least, was Keira Metz's approach. Finding herself in a bit of a pinch, she asked Geralt for yet another favor. This time she needed him to track down a merchant's wagon which had been carrying some rare magic ingredients her way. It had never arrived, and she had begun to fear the worst.<br>
   1002609|00000000||It turned out these ingredients, while rare, had nothing to do with magic. They were simply delicacies, treats which Keira, accustomed to the finer things in life, pined for in her Velen exile. <br><br>Grateful for Geralt's help, she invited him to an elegant supper, during which he dined with her on these refined delights under the light of the moon. These romantic circumstances, combined with Keira's own considerable charms, must have beguiled Geralt - he forgot about the other women in his heart and gave in to the temptations of the flesh.<br><br>The delicious evening had a bitter finale, however - after its conclusion, Keira put Geralt to sleep with a spell.

Or one golem.</i><br>– Vilmir Brass, foreman at Mount Carbon<br><br>Golems are mindless matter brought to life by a spell. They obey their creator's orders without question. Their boundless strength, ability to withstand pain, endless patience and the fact that they need not one jot of food or drink makes them the best servants or guards anyone could ask for. Once provoked, they will not tire of battle until they have either crushed their opponent or themselves crumbled into dust.<br>
   1077693|00000000||Defeating a golem is extraordinarily difficult: for obvious reasons it does not bleed, if feels no fear or mercy and it is invulnerable to fire and poison. What's more, a golem's body is as hard as the rock it is sometimes heft out of, so even a silver blade will barely wound it. The monster's only weakness is acid – a blade covered in acrid oil can thus increase one's chances for victory.<br><br>Golems use no weapons, for they have no need – their fists, weighing over a hundred pounds each, can crush solid granite with one hit. A blow from a golem should thus be avoided at all costs – there is no shield that can stop it, nor sword that can parry it. That is no easy task, for these creatures are able to move with surprising speed. Luckily, their enormous mass means they are not very agile – once a golem begins a charge, it cannot stop quickly, a fact experienced witchers use to their advantage.

You'd smuggle a few bottles of hooch into Oxenfurt, hang out near the dormitories selling it to students, you'd come away with a hefty sack of coin and they'd have their spirits fortified for study. Then along came Radovid, shut down the university, chased the students off and put up ballistae on the riverbank to shoot everything floating the Pontar, swans included.<br><br>But there hasn't been a dark-cloud yet that didn't have a silver lining. Yesterday I saw our brave soldiers sink a merchant vessel. Went straight to the bottom along with its entire crew - and its cargo. A shame about the men - but it would also be a shame if all those goods went to waste.

The witcher only managed to obtain a few perfunctory notes about his ward, though thankfully these contained some scraps of valuable information. It seemed Ciri had been a guest of the Bloody Baron, the self-proclaimed ruler of Velen, and that she had quarreled with some witch, presumably the one living near the village of Midcopse.

    397261|00000000||<i>Despite what is commonly thought, peasants do not interrupt their labors at midday to get out of the sun – they do it to avoid noonwraiths.</i><br>– Vlad Reymond, <i>Peasants and Their Customs</i><br><br>On particularly searing summer days, when the sun reaches its zenith, wraiths will at times appear, resembling sun-scorched women dressed in long, white robes. These are noonwraiths – the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible.<br><br>
   1077306|00000000||Noonwraiths are only known to haunt rural areas, and usually stay near the place of their deaths. They prey on peasants working in the fields or children playing nearby.<br><br>Noonwraiths do not bleed and are for the most part immune to the effects of Witcher Signs. They can create mirror images of themselves which circle their victims in a kind of morbid parody of a dance. This ghastly ritual drains their victims' life energy while adding to their own strength. Noonwraiths are also able to manipulate the physical world to a limited degree, kicking up clouds of dust which temporarily blind and disorient their opponents. <br><br>Noonwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force a noonwraith to take corporeal form, one must first trap it with the Yrden Sign or strike it with a Moon Dust bomb. Once the monster has regained physical presence, one can mount a fast attack with a silver blade, preferably one coated in specter oil.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are much weaker then than during the day.

Passing armies had razed Willoughby to the ground. Yennefer was nowhere in sight.

   1050762|00000000||Ultimately it was Yennefer who found Geralt. The one-time lovers had not even a moment to enjoy their reunion, for Yennefer insisted they ride to Vizima as quickly as possible.

    346837|00000000||Defeat the bears.
   1051105|00000000||With Geralt's help, both Hjalmar and Cerys had defied death and won glory, greatly improving their chances in the race for Skellige's throne. Crach decided the news was an excellent excuse to host a great feast, during which skalds would sing the praises of the young an Craites and tables laden with mead and meat would sway those islanders who were still undecided, convincing them to support this generous and powerful family. Geralt was also invited to the celebration, where he was to receive a token of Crach's gratitude.<br>
   1051107|00000000||A Skellige saying holds that at a good feast, blood and mead flow in equal measure. Sadly, it seems someone took the saying literally and orchestrated a terrible massacre during the banquet at Kaer Trolde. Between the third and fourth courses of roast ram, massive, enraged bears suddenly appeared amidst the merrymakers. Before the hooch-dazed warriors could draw their weapons, the animals tore dozens of guests to shreds, including most of the claimants to the throne.<br><br>Geralt managed to save most of the other attendees, but could do nothing to stop the torrent of accusations and calumnies directed at Crach once the dust had settled. The other jarls accused him of conspiring to put one of his own on the throne. If an Craite could not prove his innocence, his family would forever lay buried beneath a mountain of shame.<br><br>Hjalmar and Cerys immediately took action, each in their own way. If he wanted to investigate how the massacre had come to pass, Geralt would need to choose which an Craite to support.<br>
   1051108|00000000||Geralt decided to help Cerys. This was not surprising - her calm and systematic approach to the matter bore a strong resemblance to how the witcher himself conducted investigations.<br>
   1051111|00000000||Yet Arnvald got his just deserts when he was the one to die at the hands of traitors. The full measure of justice, however, had not yet been meted out - it was discovered that Arnvald had not acted on his own initiative, meaning the massacre's true mastermind remained at large. What luck, then, that Geralt and Cerys quickly found clues as to the treasonous murderer's identity. It turned out the culprit was none other than Birna, King Bran's widow and mother to one of the claimants to the throne, Svanrige.<br>
   1051115|00000000||Arnvald tried to save his life by fleeing, but he did not get far - for Geralt, accustomed to chasing down griffins and wyverns, outrunning a clumsy and panicked rider proved no challenge. Cerys interrogated him adroitly and got from him the identity of his patron. It turned out the culprit was none other than Birna, King Bran's widow and mother to one of the claimants to the throne, Svanrige.<br>
   1051118|00000000||In the end Geralt decided to help Hjalmar. Like him, the witcher felt there was no time to go over everything with a fine-toothed comb - they had to act now, while the trail was still fresh.<br>
   1051126|00000000||Their thorough investigation led Cerys and Geralt to an unexpected discovery. It turned out Arnvald, the an Craite family's hitherto faithful servant, had had a hand in the massacre. It was he who spiked the mead with the blood and herbs that caused certain guests to transform into bears. It was he who then tried to kill Geralt and Cerys in a most underhanded manner when they were close to finding him out.<br>
   1051128|00000000||Geralt rode off with Hjalmar to the Vildkaarls' village located in the wildest Skellige highlands. Young an Craite was convinced these mysterious warriors had transformed into the bears that massacred the Kaer Trolde feastgoers. It turned out his intuition had not led them astray. Geralt found a hidden passage in the village leading to a vast cavern. When they entered it, the whole gruesome riddle unraveled before their very eyes...<br>
   1051130|00000000||The dark legends about the Vildkaarls were true. Geralt and Hjalmar saw this for themselves when they got a hidden peek at a terrifying ritual in which a man who wished to join the ranks of this bizarre warrior society let a bear devour him alive. Geralt tried to get the druid who conducted the ceremony to tell him who was responsible for the Kaer Trolde massacre. The druid refused to answer - and Hjalmar showed that it was vengeance more than testimony that interested him. He killed the druid, who took the knowledge of his patron's identity with him to the grave.<br>
   1051131|00000000||Birna was tried by a council of jarls. Though Geralt and Cerys presented damning testimony against her, for a moment it seemed the sly widow would escape justice. In the end, the final nail in her coffin was pounded in by her own son, Svanrige, who sensed her lie at once when she denied the accusations. Birna was given the sentence she deserved and disgrace covered the name of the once-proud Tuirseach family.<br>
   1051141|00000000||Though Hjalmar was not able to uncover who stood behind the massacre at Kaer Trolde, the testimony he and Geralt provided clearly showed the hosts had not had a hand in it, and that those murdered during the feast had been properly avenged - thus clearing the an Craite family name of all suspicion. Crach and his children were still far from safe, however - the traitor responsible for the bloodshed remained at large, uncaptured and ready to strike again.<br>
   1087109|00000000||Crach's invitation was tempting, to be sure, but Geralt decided not to take him up on it. Instead of attending the feast and collecting his reward, he went off to pursue other, more important matters, such as finding the Sunstone and defeating Eredin.
   1087110|00000000||In the end Geralt decided Cerys and Hjalmar were perfectly capable of taking care of themselves without his assistance. Meanwhile he had more important things to tend to - ones tied to Ciri. He thus left Kaer Trolde and let the investigation into the massacre run its own course.
   1087232|00000000||Cerys had always struck Geralt as the wiser of Crach's two children, which is why he decided to go with her to investigate who was behind the massacre. Yet once he saw how well she was handling said investigation, he decided he was not needed there and left to tend to his own matters.
   1087233|00000000||Hjalmar was a man of action and it was this that convinced Geralt to cast his lot with him and his methods. They set out together to find those responsible for the massacre, but Geralt quickly realized Hjalmar could manage just fine without his intervention, so he left him to it and set about seeing to his own business.

   1055890|00000000||There were only a handful of nonhumans in White Orchard. One of them was the dwarf Willis, an excellent blacksmith whose wares attracted peasants from far and wide. Sadly, his forge had burned to the ground shortly before Geralt arrived. Willis suspected the fire had been started deliberately and asked the witcher to investigate this alleged arson.<br>
   1055891|00000000||Geralt is capable of finding a doppler in a crowded city or tracking a forktail against a pitch-black sky from five leagues off, so hunting down an arsonist in White Orchard did not prove much of a challenge. It turned out the culprit was a simple peasant who delighted in simple pleasures: vodka and the persecution of nonhumans.<br>
   1055892|00000000||In the end Geralt decided not to reveal the arsonist's identity to Willis. Perhaps it was the coin offered in exchange for his silence that convinced him, or perhaps he simply concluded the man was clearly the village idiot and shouldn't be punished for his deeds which, while dastardly, could not possibly have been done with much deliberation and forethought - for the man was capable of neither.
   1055893|00000000||Geralt brought the arsonist to Willis. The dwarf immediately summoned Nilfgaardian soldiers - with whom it turned out he was on quite good terms. The imperials quickly declared the man guilty, handed down a sentence and carried it on the spot. Harsh justice - or maybe just harsh?

Seeing others, however, gives you an itching pain in your back and a desire to reach for your blade.<br><br>For Geralt, Letho of Gulet had a foot in both of these camps. This renegade witcher of the School of the Viper had the blood of at least two Nordling kings on his hands, the fruit of his cooperation with Nilfgaard's emperor, Emhyr var Emreis. Accused of these crimes, Geralt was forced to chase down Letho to clear his own name. Though both walked away from their final confrontation in the ruins of Loc Muinne alive and unharmed, Geralt did not think he would ever see Letho again.<br><br>It thus came as quite a shock when he happened across Letho in a barn loft somewhere in the war-ravaged Temerian borderlands.<br>
   1062449|00000000||It turned out Letho's former employer was less than satisfied with his performance and had set a variety of blood hounds on his trail. In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt, however, could not shake the bad taste left in his mouth by their prior interactions and went his own way, leaving Letho to clean up his own mess.<br>

In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt remembered the care Letho had given Yennefer and, in a show of solidarity, decided to help his former companion deal with his pursuers.<br>
   1062451|00000000||In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver – faking his own death. His plan would have worked perfectly, too, had Geralt's hero reflexes not been a tad overstrung, causing him to butcher any and all witnesses who might have spread the news.<br>
   1062452|00000000||In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver – faking his own death. Although Geralt had no forewarning of this, he improvised with aplomb and sent Letho's pursuers off convinced they had rid the world of a kingslayer.<br>
   1062453|00000000||After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. He and Geralt shared a brief farewell and then went their separate ways once more.<br>
   1062454|00000000||After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. Geralt proposed he hide out at Kaer Morhen for a while, and after a bit of thought Letho agreed.<br>
   1062455|00000000||Though some of Geralt's companions did not extend Letho a very warm welcome, the decision to invite him to Kaer Morhen proved wiser than Geralt could have known.

   1083669|00000000||Geralt realized the fight against Eredin and his soldiers would most likely be the most difficult challenge he had ever faced. In addition, the stakes were higher than ever before - this time he was not fighting for his own life, but for that of Ciri and, by extension, the entire world. Since extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures, the witcher decided to swallow his pride and go to the emperor of Nilfgaard for help.<br>
   1083670|00000000||His talk with Emhyr did not go as he had wanted. The clash of two strong wills resulted in neither being able to accepted the other's conditions. The witcher thus walked away empty handed.

Harpies, though - they like shiny things.</i><br>– Letho, Viper School witcher<br><br>It is hard to say what is most repulsive about harpies and their cousins, the shishigas: their hideous appearance, the overwhelming stench of rot and bird excrement that clings to them or their bloodcurdling screech. Suffice it to say that even rats, who dwell happily among the rankest fecal matter and rotten waste, give their nests wide berth.<br>
   1077903|00000000||Harpy nests are most often found atop high cliffs or rocky ravines. Sure signs of having strayed near one are crumbling human and animal remains, guano-streaked rocks and feathers littering the ground.<br><br>Harpies and shishigas hunt in flocks consisting of a handful to up to twenty individuals. Though rather cowardly and cautious, harpies fiercely defend their nests and will not hesitate to attack when outnumbering their foes. <br><br>During combat they use their ability to fly to dive swiftly to strike their victims one by one before soaring back up out of reach. They can kill with their wings or their sharp beak and talons. Once on the ground they move slowly and clumsily, and thus no longer present much of a threat.

   1048618|00000000||Geralt found the last Crone in the swamp village and killed her.

But if your cart throws an axle and you get stuck out there... Well, close your eyes and pray to Melitele.</i><br>– Kurt Hammerbach, city guardsman in Vengerberg<br><br>A lone nekker is harmless. Five are dangerous. Ten can kill even a veteran monster slayer. Particularly troublesome are the larger, stronger individuals known as warriors, as well as the rare breed of nekkers known as phoocas.<br>
   1077849|00000000||Nekkers and phoocas live in the dark woods that grow in damp, mist-filled valleys, in colonies of one to several dozen individuals. They dig deep burrows for lairs and connect them with a network of narrow tunnels. Using these passageways they are able to move at great speed within and around their colonies.<br><br>Nekkers always attack in groups and by surprise. They try to surround their prey as quickly as possible, cutting off all escape routes. Luckily their attack is for the most part disorganized, for nekkers are not gifted with great courage and individual nekkers will often hesitate before overcoming their fear and striking. When fighting them one can use this moment of hesitation to kill the braver individuals before finishing off those who remain in the back.

   1049525|00000000||A magic cataclysm had devastated a large part of the isle of Ard Skellig, and Yennefer suspected Ciri had had something to do with it. The raven-haired sorceress thus set out with Geralt to the isle's mysteriously deformed woods to look for signs of their one-time ward's presence.
   1060562|00000000||Yennefer was not mistaken. Ciri had indeed been in Skellige. With her was a mysterious mage, and chasing them both - the Wild Hunt. When Ermion heard this, his first thought was of the Hunt's recent attack on the isle of Hindarsfjall - perhaps it, too, was connected to Ciri.

   1073177|00000000||Mh. There.
   1048598|00000000||In the mission to gather the members of the former Lodge of Sorceress, it fell to Yennefer to bring Margarita Laux-Antille to Novigrad. Yennefer's old friend had been captured by the witch hunters and was being kept in Deireadh, the best-guarded prison this side of the Yaruga.<br><br>Geralt and Yennefer thus had a hard endeavor in front of them - they would have to break into the sealed compound and sneak Margarita out. Good thing Yen had something even better than a file in a carrot cake: contact information for the one man who had managed to escape Deireadh. Escaping seemed to be in his blood, for he attempted to make another getaway at the sight of Yennefer and Geralt, but eventually they caught him and sat down for a chat. He told them how to outfox the guards and enter the prison unnoticed. With no time to waste, Geralt and Yennefer raced off to Margarita's rescue.<br>
   1048600|00000000||When Geralt reached the cell in which Margarita was held, he uncovered a shocking surprise. Rita was not alone in her cell: Síle de Tansarville lay there as well, clinging to life with the last scraps of her strength. It turned out she had been captured long before Margarita and her body had been broken by the constant torture she'd undergone since. Síle had only one last wish - she wanted to depart this world in dignity, and so asked Geralt to end her suffering.<br>
   1048601|00000000||Geralt did not kill Síle de Tansarville. What prompted this decision? I do not know and quite possibly will never find out. Perhaps his nerves failed him, or perhaps he simply did not want another sorceress' blood on his hands. As for Síle, she saw only cruelty in his actions and cursed him for leaving her to die in agony in the miserable confines of a dank Deireadh cell. Then Yennefer took matters into her own hands - and ended Síle's life.
   1048602|00000000||Geralt granted Sile's last request and ended her pain with one expert blow. Though they had not always enjoyed the best of relations, he felt this had to be done, as no one deserved to die a slow and painful death in a dank Deireadh cell.<br>
   1051069|00000000||With their powers combined, Yennefer and Geralt freed Margarita from the most formidable prison in the North. Rita was in a very sorry state, but the knowledge that she was free and would not perish on a pyre fortified her strength. Yennefer showered her long-time friend with tender care, and everyone hoped for a swift recovery.

I tried to fish it out, but some devil must live on the bottom there, cause every time I tossed my net, I'd catch a snare. Maybe there's, I don't know, some way I can repay you?

   1085075|00000000||Skellige Woman
   1078102|00000000||Last week the three of us grabbed this traveler. Looked like the kind of cowardly fuck starts shitting his breeches at the first sight of you. But seems looks can be deceiving. Bastard started waving a sword, cut my ear off and sliced Olaf's arse so deep he's got an extra crack, except the new one's horizontal. Then he smacked Ivar in the forehead with the hilt. Poor sod's still dizzy.<br><br>We snuffed him in the end, of course - every fellow's doomed when he's outnumbered. But it turned out he had a handful of coins in his pouch, a copper ring on his finger - and that's it. We lost out on that robbery - paid more to the herbalist for patching up than we took from the whoreson. So afterwards Olaf said, "Why the devil risk our necks waiting around for travelers, when gold's literally sitting right under our feet - buried with the dead?" A corpse can't defend itself, so the risk of injury's nil. No need to wait around all day till someone walks by - there's already a couple dozen someone's waiting for us, lying in their graves, each one marked out like veg at a grocer's.<br><br>So I gave it a good think and concluded Olaf's talking sense. So starting tomorrow we're going to stay off the roads and do our looting in the graveyard instead.<br>
   1078103|00000000||It turned out robbing corpses was not the gold mine Olaf and his crew had imagined. The witcher, though, made a tidy profit off their "labors".
   1087011|00000000||Unwary visitors to cemeteries just might find their stay prolonged indefinitely. The dead don't always like having their rest disturbed, while necrophages never like having their meals interrupted. One time, the witcher happened across just such a group of underprepared, or possibly simply unlucky, cemetery-goers. One of them had been carrying notes of some kind. Driven by curiosity and, I must surmise, a lack of anything better to do at that precise moment, Geralt set about reading the sloppily-written document...

    480940|00000000||Should I tell the Temple Guard?

   1061128|00000000||Otrygg an Hindar, Jarl Donar's grandson and heir, was the youngest of the claimants to Skellige's throne. He dreamed of the heroic deeds and daring raids he would one day lead his subjects in accomplishing.<br>
   1061129|00000000||Otrygg never got to live out those dreams, however. During the tragic feast that came to be known as the "Bloody Banquet" he lost is life when a furious bear tore his flesh to small pieces.

    168432|00000000||Must be that famous witcher.
    168404|00000000||Wonder where types like that come from?
    168434|00000000||Got a sea beast about that they summoned a witcher?

    168444|00000000||Hm?
    168426|00000000||Why so testy?
    168408|00000000||Someone Crach summoned?
    545886|00000000||Akh akh akh.
    546536|00000000||King Bran? Why, a traitor the Black Ones bought poisoned 'im! That's fact!
    546538|00000000||Can't be!
    546540|00000000||Think the druids speak true?
    546542|00000000||Wild Hunt only knows.
    545888|00000000||Mercy!
    545890|00000000||Gods, don't ye take my strength.
   1086912|00000000||Obstacles
   1086913|00000000||Your horse will automatically jump over or navigate around any obstacles it encounters.
   1055887|00000000||Many think that the life of a witcher consists of nothing but adventure after grand adventure, an endless stream of contracts on manticores, bruxae and other exotic beasts. In truth, Geralt would often take on more banal tasks, ones lesser bards fear mentioning, for they lack the skill required to make a masterwork of the mundane. By way of example, once in White Orchard he was hired to retrieve a woman's... frying pan.<br>
   1055888|00000000||Geralt found the frying pan and returned it to the old woman. She was overcome with joy and gratitude - not only did she have her precious cooking utensil back, but someone had scrubbed it clean for her as well!
   1055889|00000000||A mysterious gentleman had borrowed the frying pan from a little old lady and not returned it. While investigating this damned unneighborly act, Geralt discovered the delinquent borrower had other, more serious sins on his conscience... murder, for example. The half-burned notes Geralt found in his abandoned hut made it clear he was interested in the movements of Nilfgaardian forces and confidential military secrets - in other words, the man was a spy.<br>
   1039710|00000000||Break into the locked hut.
   1039714|00000000||Look around inside the hut for a frying pan using your Witcher Senses.
   1058276|00000000||Search the hut and use your Witcher Senses to determine what happened there.

   1061116|00000000||Madman Lugos' sole child and heir was a dour, strapping lad who was nothing like his father.

   1055912|00000000||My story began in Temeria, near Vizima, with Geralt dreaming a dream of Yennefer, Ciri and the Wild Hunt. It ends in Temeria as well, with the witcher returning to Vizima to have one last conversation with the emperor - and tell him Ciri would not be coming back.<br>
   1050594|00000000||After his meeting with Emhyr var Emreis, Geralt set off for White Orchard, where he had agreed to meet someone amidst the ruins of the old castle there.<br>
   1055913|00000000||And who awaited Geralt in White Orchard? Ciri - packed and ready to set off on the Path. Where did the witcher and his ward venture, you ask, and what became of them? That, dear reader, is another story.<br>

   1037309|00000000||Welcome to our humble forge. How can we be of help?
   1033428|00000000||Looking for someone who can craft me some armor. Gotta be top quality.
   1033462|00000000||Strong and light will do just fine.
   1033477|00000000||Comfortable, strong and light'll do just fine.
   1030742|00000000||Got the tools.
   1030743|00000000||Went to Undvik a while ago. Found these.
   1033856|00000000||Unimportant. What matters is I got 'em.
   1033870|00000000||Long story… Might tell it some day, but right now I need that armor.
   1033919|00000000||What about my armor?
   1033930|00000000||Can't turn away a Nilfgaardian general, I get it… But hope it doesn't mean you've forgotten about my armor.
   1033932|00000000||We haven't. Well, I haven't, and won't. 'Cause I'll be the one to make it, understand? And the Nilfgaardian's armor. And every other suit he agrees to make.
   1033971|00000000||Gotta say - hard to believe.
   1034083|00000000||Gotta admit, find your story hard to believe myself…
   1034095|00000000||I'll prove it to you. Fergus can make the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll craft another suit. We'll see who's is better.
   1030860|00000000||Lemme think about it.
   1030870|00000000||Hmm… Need to think about it.
   1030871|00000000||I see. Well, I've work to do. But should you decide to help me… I'd craft armor for you, lots of it. The kind no other armorer can.
   1030861|00000000||Bound to be a notice posted for the griffin anyway. Could kill two beasts with one stone. Fine, I'll see what I can do.
   1030869|00000000||Bring me the acid, and I'll prove I'm better than Fergus. And I'll craft armor for you, lots of it, the kind no other armorer can.
   1030859|00000000||Fine. I'll bring you acid.
   1034238|00000000||I need but one thing I can't get on my own. Would you help me?
   1034239|00000000||Depends what it is.
   1034240|00000000||To finish the armor, I'll need to harden it, quench it in a bath. Oil's what we usually use, but I want to use acid.
   1034275|00000000||Hmm… Kikimores and archgriffins spit acid.
   1034285|00000000||Archgriffins? Draconic griffins, you mean? Baron's men came by a few days back. Said they'd seen one north of Crow's Perch. It'd killed some folk out there.
   1034033|00000000||If that's the case, stand your ground. Don't let him treat you like this.
   1034041|00000000||I won't, not anymore. He can craft the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll make another suit, and we'll see which one's better.
   1033969|00000000||Shouldn't allow it.
   1033938|00000000||Hmm… So what's Fergus do?
   1033940|00000000||Horseshoes, nails… Not much else he can do, seeing as he cocks up simple bungs.
   1033961|00000000||But in the end, they call him "master." No one'd ever think I could be a skilled armorer - a human, and a woman to boot. A dwarven blacksmith - that's another story…
   1033928|00000000||Enough?
   1033933|00000000||They treat me like I'm nobody, the menial labor. Truth is, the Nilfgaardian, the one Fergus is kissing up to - I'll have to craft his armor. Yours, too, for that matter.
   1033918|00000000||Whaddaya mean?
   1033888|00000000||Harmon aep Groenekan, lieutenant general of the Second Mounted Army.
   1033890|00000000||Welcome to our humble establishment! A true honor to host one of such renown! I've heard the general's a connoisseur and collector of armor.
   1033891|00000000||This is true. And they call you a master of the craft.
   1033904|00000000||All too kind, sir, tru--
   1033906|00000000||I need a suit of armor. Heavy, able to withstand piercing projectiles.
   1033900|00000000||Piercin' projectiles? Bolts, you mean? Hmm, that ain't easy, needs a special alloy, temperin'…
   1033902|00000000||The new tools - we can do it! Stoke the fire, I'll ready the rest!
   1033912|00000000||Bold, your worker. You allow her much.
   1033914|00000000||Er, you know how it is, general. Good help's hard to come by. We should go outside, there's business to discuss…
   1033917|00000000||It's always the same! I've had enough!
   1033859|00000000||Wasn't easy. Sooo… I'm hoping for a good price - on that armor of mine.
   1033853|00000000||Wasn't easy, so I'm hoping for a good price.
   1030746|00000000||Well, goose kick me! These look like the real thing…
   1030747|00000000||Because they are - look at the markings! Authentic! How did you get them?!
   1030741|00000000||Forge was carved out of a rock face. Probably why it still stands. Tools were inside…
   1033574|00000000||Look for the tools next time I'm in Skellige. Take care now.
   1033563|00000000||Farewell.
   1033562|00000000||Know where the forge is?
   1033565|00000000||These legends mention where the forge might be?
   1033572|00000000||Yes, north side of the isle, in a cave. Clan folk carved out a rock face to build it.
   1030739|00000000||Worth looking into. Say I find the tools, will you craft the armor for me?
   1030740|00000000||Ahem. On condition you bring the tools. But only then.
   1033486|00000000||Oughta know one thing when it comes to armor: if it's gotta be durable, it can't be light.
   1033491|00000000||It can. Just needs the proper tools to make it. Tools like the folk of Clan Tordarroch used on Undvik.
   1033541|00000000||Yoana, I told you time and again to stay silent when I talk to customers. Shouldn't pester folk with those nonsense Skellige legends o' yours.
   1033543|00000000||It ain't legend, and it ain't nonsense. My granddad would go to Undvik for his armor, said Tordarroch folk made the best. Till last year, that is, when a giant ravaged their island. Inhabitants either ran off or died, but the forge should still be in one piece.
   1033475|00000000||Sounds great. Can you make a suit like that?
   1033485|00000000||No, but find someone who can, and I'll gladly meet 'em.
   1033461|00000000||Could it?
   1033413|00000000||Well, I've been at it twenty years, now. Mastered the craft in some respects, if I do say so myself.
   1033423|00000000||You wish…
   1033430|00000000||Don't listen to her. She's been sore lately, snortin' every chance she gets.
   1033432|00000000||So, what kind of armor are we talkin' about?
   1033449|00000000||Light but durable. Can't constrain movement, and I gotta be able to get in it without anybody's help.
   1033450|00000000||That all? Sure it shouldn't be self-cleanin'? And how about it wipe your arse after ye take a shite in the bushes?
   1030677|00000000||Need some armor, really good armor. Word is you're the one to talk to about that.

   1061358|00000000||Finally, after so many faint and elusive trails, Geralt had happened upon something directly tied to Ciri's disappearance. The Hunt had chased her and her companion to the shores of Skellige. There they had boarded a boat and sailed off into the unknown. A short while later, the boat returned, but with only one passenger: a twisted creature that, if a man, was very likely the ugliest in the world. The gnarled lump had found its way into Jarl Donar of Hindarsfjall's care, and so that is where Geralt went to next.
   1061359|00000000||Sadly, Donar had sold the misshapen thing to a passing merchant. The strange being had then been shipped off to Novigrad, and there the trail ended.

So the witcher ventured into the swamps, determined to find this bog-dwelling witch and ask her about Ciri.<br>

   1059069|00000000||When Ciri arrived in Velen, she found herself in the very heart of the notorious Crookback Bog. Exhausted, she sought shelter, but instead found herself in the clutches of three demonic sisters known to the local peasants as the Ladies of the Wood. Ciri quickly realized how poorly that name fit these bloodthirsty hags and fled. She escaped with her life by a hair's breadth, but still had a long and dangerous trek through the marshes ahead of her.<br>
   1059070|00000000||Crookback Bog is home to more than its fair share of horrifying beasts, but none of them hold a candle to the general of the Wild Hunt who chased Ciri now. Imlerith - for that was his name - had arrived on the Crones' summons to take Ciri back to his king. The young witcher was able to give her pursuer the slip, but the two foes were destined to meet again in the future.

   1061784|00000000||Geralt first met Keira Metz when she literally dropped on top of him out of nowhere. During the infamous coup on Thanedd Island, Keira was defenestrated and nearly landed right on the witcher's head. The next time Geralt saw her, in the swamps of Velen, was shocking in a different way - the luxury-loving sorceress was the last person he expected to see in such a grim and barren place.<br> <br>Geralt later learned the reason for this, and Keira's fate gave him ample fodder for contemplating the cruel whimsies of the wheel of fortune. Once the esteemed advisor to the now late King Foltest, she had been chased out of Temeria when she lost that ruler's trust. Later she joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, which earned her the hatred of Redania's king and Nilfgaard's emperor alike. Because of this, she had gone deep undercover, posing as a cunning woman, a village witch of sorts, deep in the Velen boondocks. It was not at all difficult to tell that she despised every minute of this.<br>
   1061785|00000000||Keira quickly seized on the witcher as an expected helpmate. In return for showing him where a certain mysterious elf dwelled, she asked Geralt to help her retrieve a magic lamp from the nearby elven ruins.<br>
   1061787|00000000||Keira then asked Geralt for another favor: lifting the curse from the tower on Fyke Isle. Curses and favors being what Geralt does best, he obliged.<br>
   1061793|00000000||Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal.<br><br>Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation -and continued saying yes all evening.<br>
   1061794|00000000||Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal.<br><br>Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation for dinner - but, showing unusual restraint, turned down her other, decidedly unambiguous propositions.<br>
   1061798|00000000||Sadly, an evening that started out so nicely ended quite unfortunately for the witcher. Keira put him to sleep with a secretly-cast spell. Clearly, she wanted to hide something from him…<br>
   1061800|00000000||It turned out that Keira had played the witcher like a well-tuned harp, strumming all the right chords to keep him occupied while she stole the mage Alexander's notes from Fyke Isle. She was planning to use the notes as a bargaining chip while making a deal with Radovid. His plague research could be her ticket back to life without lice, ticks and omnipresent filth.<br>
   1061802|00000000||Though her planned move was as stupid as it was risky, Keira was deaf to all Geralt's arguments. In the end he had to admit he had no right to stop her, and so Keira left, taking Alexander's notes with her.<br>
   1061804|00000000||In the end Geralt succeeded in squelching Keira's mad plan to bargain with a man whose favorite negotiating tools were red-hot pincers and burning pyres. Keira changed her destination from Oxenfurt to the decidedly safer confines of Kaer Morhen.<br>
   1061806|00000000||Keira was determined to get her way, but Geralt could not allow her to carry out her plans. Both refused to budge, leading to a fight in which Keira Metz lost her life.<br>
   1061809|00000000||During the battle for Kaer Morhen Keira fought bravely against Eredin's minions and saved Lambert from certain death.<br>
   1061812|00000000||Later it turned out that fighting side by side had forged a bond between Keira and Lambert and they decided to continue developing it after the battle was over. This confirmed my theory that witchers and sorceresses clearly share some mystical mutual attraction.<br>
   1061813|00000000||Sadly the sorceress' desperate plans fell apart in the face of Radovid's cruel madness. Keira Metz shared the unhappy fate of so many of her fellow mages and was executed on Radovid's orders.<br>
   1061824|00000000||Geralt never found out why Keira had cast that spell, nor why she had expressed such an interest in Fyke Isle. Her execution, however, gave indisputable proof that her plan, whatever it was, ended in failure.<br>

   1061635|00000000||The Nilfgaardian Tavar Eggebracht came from a family with a long military tradition. His ancestors had proudly served under the Golden Sun banner during the conquests of Maecht, Geso and Metinna, fighting and dying for their emperor.<br><br>That last fate was met by Tavar's cousin, Colonel Tibor Eggebracht, who fell in the Battle of Brenna during the previous Northern War. Despite this fact Tavar felt no hatred for Nordlings, considering his cousin's death a grievous yet inevitable consequence of war.<br><br>He performed his duties as quartermaster diligently, with the good of his soldiers his top priority.<br>

    335786|00000000||Meet Zoltan in the Kingfisher Inn after sundown.
   1046082|00000000||Priscilla told Geralt about the ruckus I had supposedly raised at Whoreson Junior's headquarters, and that I had been planning to rob treasure from Sigi Reuven, a man better known to Geralt as Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence. Geralt now realized I was up the proverbial creek in a leaky boat without a paddle, surrounded by man-eating crocodiles - and he would have to swim to my rescue.
   1049910|00000000||Geralt had learned from the dreamer Corinne Tilly that Ciri contacted me while in Novigrad. He thus made his way to the Rosemary and Thyme, a charming establishment which I had inherited from an admirer of my poetry, for he, quite rationally, expected to find me there. His search for Ciri seemed closer to a happy conclusion than ever before.<br>
   1049913|00000000||Alas, fate had raised his hopes only to dash them cruelly back to the ground. Geralt did not find me at my proprietorship. His despair was partially lifted when he came across our old friend, Zoltan Chivay - but the dwarf had just returned from a long journey and knew nothing of my fate or that of Ciri. Concern wrinkling his brow, Zoltan helped Geralt search every corner of the establishment for clues about where I might be. Other than a few triflings, all they found was a planner containing notes about the women I had met with in the days prior to my disappearance. They divided the names between them and ventured into the city to find the women and ask what they knew.<br>
   1049917|00000000||Geralt conversed with the ladies whose company I had recently graced. Though each had fond memories of these encounters, none knew where I might be now. Geralt gleaned from their stories that there was one person who might know more: a famous and talented trobairitz named Priscilla.<br><br>It so happened this ravishing starlet was still in town and performing every night at the Kingfisher Inn. Like it or not, the witcher was in for an evening of fine culture, at the end of which he hoped to take the artist aside for a serious chat.<br>

   1051229|00000000||Near Novigrad Geralt came across a village whose inhabitants had themselves a bit of a ghoul problem. These nasty necrophages had taken up residence in their barn and posed a threat to the living. Geralt agreed to help the peasants - for commensurate pay, of course.<br>
   1051230|00000000||Getting rid of the ghouls did not prove much of a problem for the witcher. A few chops and slices and he was ready to collect his reward.

    564171|00000000||Awful pale, y'are.
   1078225|00000000||Soldiers have come. Whether ours or there's - don't know. Don't really matter anymore. I heard them riding down the road. Hid. Nailed the door shut. Maybe they won't get in.<br><br>They spent the whole night killing and raping. I saw it all through the cracks in the wall. Bit my finger to the bone trying to keep from screaming. Don't know if anyone else managed to hide. Maybe not. I saw them drag Antosh out. He had hid in the fields, next to the haystack where he'd stashed his things. They flailed him.<br><br>They've heard me. Know I'm in here. I didn't open up when they pounded. I thought they'd burn me out, just like they did those who hid in the granary. Then they got on their horses, rode off. Quiet, now. All I can hear's the flies circling the bodies.<br><br>I tried to knock open the door. Open the window. Dig myself out. Make a hole in the wall or the roof. Nothing doing.<br><br>I heard people who came to rob corpses. Don't know of what, all's left is soiled shirts and foot wrappings. I called for help. They didn't answer. Only ones who'll come now are the ghouls.<br>
   1078226|00000000||Sadly, the author of these notes, whoever he was, had quite accurately predicted his own future. Since his writing stated everyone but he had died, their was no heir left alive to collect the man's fortune. Geralt thus took it for himself. After all, he reasoned, he would make better use of it than the ghouls.
   1087005|00000000||While passing through a burned-down village, Geralt came across a body. After indulging in his bizarre habit of searching every rotting corpse that crosses his path, he found the departed individual had been carrying a set of notes written in a very unsteady hand. Figuring these might be the dying man's last words, Geralt decided to read them closely…

In order to defeat a penitent, one must remain in constant motion in order to avoid being struck by this agile creature, which can disappear and reappear in the blink of an eye to attack from behind. Most importantly of all, however, one must discover what keeps the monster bound to its haunting grounds - and break that bond as soon as possible.

   1051194|00000000||The Nilfgaardian and Redanian forces had fought many bloody yet indecisive battles in Velen from which both sides had to retreat without collecting their dead. On one such field Geralt encountered a group of looters robbing the corpses of the fallen. In another time and place he might have merely grit his teeth and continued on his way. Yet conditions in Velen were harsh and other sources of sustenance few - so he decided to swallow his revulsion and defend these desparate men from the monsters stalking the battlefield.<br>
   1051195|00000000||Hiring a witcher was one of the best ideas the looters' leader had ever hit upon. Geralt dutifully kept the monsters at bay while they completed their grim harvest.
    358211|00000000||Bitter Harvest
   1039532|00000000||Momentous decisions altering the fate of entire nations are often made under unusual circumstances. For example, when Geralt was asked to take part in the assassination of King Radovid, he was standing in a bathhouse in Novigrad, half-naked and staring at a sweat-soaked Dijkstra. If he agreed to join in, he was to attend a meeting in a warehouse by the docks. There the co-conspirators would hash out the details of their plan to kill the most powerful ruler in the North.<br>
   1039568|00000000||Their bold plan succeeded: the Redanian king was assassinated on the bridge leading to Temple Isle. Radovid's was not the last blood to be spilled as a result of this conspiracy, however. With no more common goal to bind them, the co-conspirators turned on each other.<br><br>Geralt, who has always cherished his neutrality, decided not to get involved and left the assassin's hideout before fighting began. Though Roche and his band had already overcome a great deal, it was clear they would not be able to defeat the overwhelming numbers of Dijkstra's thugs. Madame Irina's empty theater hosted a brutal spectacle in which the fiercest Temerian patriots met a bloody end.
   1039596|00000000||Their bold plan succeeded: the Redanian king was assassinated on the bridge leading to Temple Isle. Radovid's was not the last blood to be spilled as a result of this conspiracy, however. With no more common goal to bind them, the co-conspirators turned on each other.<br><br>Though Geralt has always prized his neutrality, he did not intend to sit idly and watch Dijkstra's thugs butcher his friends. And so the Redanian spy's long-awaited moment of triumph transformed into his final defeat at the witcher's hands.
   1087240|00000000||To this day I don't know what truly drove the witcher to take part in the assassination plot against Radovid. I also don't know what drove him to resign from this participation. Such are the facts, however: Geralt first courted high politics, then left them at the altar to fend for themselves while he saw to a more important matter: the fight against the Wild Hunt.

   1053411|00000000||In one of the now-unused bedrooms of Kaer Morhen Geralt found a note left by Berengar, a witcher who had once been his companion and colleague. The note indicated Berengar had been working on forging an exceptional sword called Tor'haerne. The note was sparing in its details, so Geralt decided to ask Vesemir if he knew something more on the subject.<br>
   1053412|00000000||The elder witcher told Geralt the story of how Berengar had tried to forge a silver sword with extraordinary characteristics. All his attempts, however, went awry and he lost the diagram while trekking downriver to kill a chort. <br><br>Geralt finished what Berengar had started: he followed the same route, killed the monster and retrieved the Tor'haerne diagram.

   1078214|00000000||I always said Musky was a clever pup! He understands more words than quite a few men. He can do all sorts of tricks - sit, roll over, and if you give him a scrap of bacon, he'll even shake your hand. But today, why, he's outdone himself today.<br><br>I look, and there's Musky, running in from the field carrying something in his mouth. I think, "Maybe it's a hare, and I'll be able to whip up a stew, sell the fur?" But no, it was a sack. All covered in blood, so no wonder he sniffed it out. I look inside... and inside there's a key. A little one, all engraved and ornamented, like it fits some fancy chest or box. So I think, "Maybe there's treasure hidden hereabouts, and that's what this key's for?" So I think I'll go for a walk, see what I can see. If I find it, I swear to Melitele, Musky's going to eat nothing but veal for the rest of his days!<br><br>That blood on the sack's got me a bit worried, though... But I'll take a thick club with me, so if anything pops out of the bushes, it'll get a thumping. You don't live but once, so you might as well take some risks, I always say!<br>
   1078215|00000000||Perhaps Musky was indeed a clever pup, but his owner was not the wisest of men, and his club didn't seem to have helped him much. Geralt's swords, on the other hand, served him very well. He hunted down the place where the treasure was hidden and, with no small amount of satisfaction, took its contents for himself.
   1086999|00000000||Geralt found a mutilated corpse which was carrying some notes. The blood which had soaked through the paper had not completely obscured the writing - and made the witcher all the more curious as to its contents…

   1059053|00000000||Geralt had been in situations where he could not prevent someone's death on more than one occasion. In fact, you might say he had grown accustomed to that particular form of agony. It is another thing altogether, however, to stand powerless and watch the unjust, cruel execution of an acquaintance for whom one has developed a fondness.<br><br>Such was his lot as regards Felicia Cori, a young sorceress whom Geralt had met while chasing the kingslayer, Letho. Though Geralt had not gotten to know her deeply, he had nonetheless taken a liking to this former pupil of Philippa Eilhart, who had seemed to him a pleasant and enterprising young woman. Yet she was a wielder of magic and, as such, met her end on a pyre.<br>

It seemed he had finally decided to emerge from the shadows, but instead of returning to high political wrangling he dove deep into the criminal underground - and quickly surfaced as one of its leading figures.<br>
   1061849|00000000||Though he did not show it, in his own way Dijkstra respected Geralt - even though the very thought of their last meeting brought a pained grimace to his face. The two had found themselves standing in each other's way during the coup on Thanedd, a stalemate quickly broken when Geralt summarily broke Dijkstra's leg.<br>
   1061850|00000000||One could pen a positively enthralling adventure tale recounting this spy's life history. A victim of Philippa Eilhart's intrigues, he had been forced to flee Redania at breakneck speed - or have his own neck broken by assassins. For a certain time he sought refuge in far-off lands, but in the end he decided to return to the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061851|00000000||Well aware of Geralt's extraordinary talents, Dijkstra asked him to help find his stolen treasure. Though Geralt knew the identity of the criminal mastermind responsible, he decided not to divulge this information and set about investigating as if the case were a complete mystery.<br>
   1061852|00000000||Though the witcher's lips remained tightly sealed regarding my role in the treasure heist, Dijkstra still sniffed out his dishonesty - and made it clear how much he disliked being played for a fool.<br>
   1061853|00000000||Though Dijkstra did not aid the persecuted mages out of the goodness of his heart, Triss appreciated his support all the same, for it proved vital to the endeavor's success.<br>
   1061854|00000000||Dijkstra opposed the mage hunts sweeping the city, but for Philippa Eilhart he was willing to make an exception. He had never forgiven his one-time friend for betraying and then trying to kill him. Unfortunately, Geralt needed Philippa alive - and was in no mood to negotiate. He thus turned to a tried and true method - and broke Dijkstra's other leg.<br>

He had never forgiven his one-time friend for betraying and then trying to kill him.

   1072861|00000000||Anyone who thought Dijkstra had broken all ties with the world of political schemers and plotters was sorely mistaken. His great comeback was to be a patriotic act that would free Redania from the rule of a madman - the assassination of King Radovid.<br>
   1072865|00000000||As an experienced dragonslayer once commented, more than once heads have only rolled after the dragon's been slain, the mead broken out and the campfire lit, for when it comes time to share the treasure, hunters of beasts often become slayers of men instead. Such was the case after the assassination of Radovid, when Dijkstra tried to renege on the terms of their arrangement and do away with Thaler and Vernon.<br><br>Dijkstra counted on Geralt maintaining witcher neutrality in this matter - a miscalculation which cost him his life.<br>

   1078141|00000000||<i>Not too long ago the areas around peasant hamlets were chock full of guardian spirits. Today it's nigh unto impossible to spot a brownie, bucca or lutin. And godlings, they are always the first to go. Such is the price we pay for civilization's forward march.</i><br>– From the preface to "The World We Have Lost," by Professor Dorregaray<br><br>Godlings (sometimes mistaken for lutin) are woodland creatures dwelling in burrows and moss-covered hollow stumps on the outskirts of human settlements. They are similar to children in behavior and appearance, and, like children, delight in mischief. Godlings are deeply rooted in their home territory and perform acts of care and guardianship to those dwelling near their burrows. They watch over people as well as animals, but, shy creatures by nature, they try to do so while remaining unseen. Godlings are drawn to joy and innocence, and so delight in the company of children and usually only show themselves to the young.<br><br>These hard-working and clever creatures gladly perform small services for those in their care, asking only for respect and payment in the form of food or cast-off tools in return. They are easily offended by churlish, ungrateful or simply rude behavior. Godlings also treasure their peace and quiet. When the village a godling watches over becomes too populous or its inhabitants forget the old ways, it will abandon its burrow for good and walk off to destinations unknown.

   1061618|00000000||Carduin of Kovir was once a wealthy and influential member of the Council of Sorcerers, a man known and respected by all the rulers of the North. After the Council imploded during the coup on Thanedd Isle, Carduin spared no expense in his quest to rebuild his brotherhood's hard-won position.<br><br>This motivated him to take part in the eventful summit in Loc Muinne, during which a handful of mages seeking to reactivate the Council were forced to accept King Radovid's patronage. After that Carduin found himself on the king's leash, completely dependent on the whims and moods of a mad ruler whom he served not out of respect but fear. The mage's pride, however, forced him to don a brave face and play out the hand fate had dealt him.<br>

   1058841|00000000||News of the Nilfgaardian army's approach led nobles of all ranks and orders to pack up their silver and flee posthaste to safer harbors, abandoning all thoughts of defending their patrimony and leaving their lands at the invaders' mercy. Lord Vserad was no exception to this rule. The magnate had ruled much of Velen from his base at Crow's Perch before fleeing with his family to take shelter in a tower on Fyke Isle.<br><br>The safety he sought there was not, however, to be found, and the massacre in which he was slaughtered became the source of a great many ghastly rumors and legends.<br>
   1058842|00000000||According to one of them, Vserad, unmoved by human suffering, had his mage poison starving peasants who had come to him to beg for food. A hideous tale, yet one that sadly seemed plausible given the desperate conditions in the land.<br>
   1058843|00000000||Yet the truth turned out, as is its wont, to be much simpler. Vserad was murdered by his traitorous former subjects, who were driven by greed, jealousy and the base jackassery that is all too widespread among the human race.<br>

   1077656|00000000||Hm. Might wanna look at the map…
   1077628|00000000||I'm too old for treks that long.
   1077658|00000000||Ugh, I'm too old to wander the world.
   1077630|00000000||Any shortcuts?

    515649|00000000||Heard some birds chirping. You've got some of the same friends. Both seem to count Radovid among your allies.
    512333|00000000||These birds, they're terribly talkative. I'll need to see them, you'll have to point them out--
    515652|00000000||Mhm. Meantime, Vernon, willing to help, or do I need to keep looking?
    515654|00000000||Hmm. As always, you've more luck than you deserve. I'm on my way to meet my Redanian contact. We're meeting near Oxenfurt, at a chess club.

   1061658|00000000||Many cannot fathom the friendship Geralt of Rivia and I, Dandelion, have shared all these years. When we first began breaking bread together, spiteful tongues said he'd be better off cutting my throat and dumping my body in a hollow tree - before I provoked someone else into doing the same to us both. Those individuals spoke out of pure jealousy, for Geralt was my dearest friend, a fact which he gave ample evidence of on numerous occasions.<br><br>I could say a great deal about that world-famous monster hunter, the man known in Elder Speech as Gwynbleidd, or, in our younger (yet no less noble) tongue, as the White Wolf. For Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade - but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience.<br><br>On the surface, he is introverted, tight-lipped, one might even say gruff, but underneath lies an overflowing sea of goodwill, good humor, and an honest readiness to help his friends, be it with a bit of sound advice or the masterful application of his blade.<br><br>Setting aside cumbersome false modesty, I can say that I know his story better than any man alive. I was with him through hard times and good, helping with wise advice, warm words and razor wit. As a result, I am a vital part of his story, both in its earlier and present portions. It is thus my duty to continue my chronicle and, for the benefit of future generations, put in writing the next chapter of his deeds and exploits.<br>

   1051266|00000000||War had transformed the once-charming student town of Oxenfurt beyond all recognition. King Radovid had expelled the students and professors, and in their place had come shady characters of all stripes. For example, while there Geralt witnessed some such thugs pestering an Oxenfurt townswoman in a most unbecoming manner.<br>
   1051267|00000000||Geralt stood up for the woman, showing the louts who the real cock of the walk was. My friend might have been created to fight monsters, but I am glad he at times chooses to fight monstrous men as well.

   1051256|00000000||Though Skelligers are famed warriors able to hold their own in almost any battle, those whom Geralt encountered near the old mine on Hindarsfjall seemed to be in need of help. They had sworn to clear the mine of ghouls and were plucking up the courage to do so, but Geralt did not deem it likely they would manage the task on their own. When he proposed his expert assistance, they hesitated at first, but ultimately decided to take him up on the offer.<br>
   1051257|00000000||What tremendous good fortune it was that Geralt showed up at just the time and place where he was needed! With a touch of help from the warriors, he made swift work of that pack of nefarious necrophages and cleansed the surrounding area of danger, earning him the gratitude of all who dwelled nearby.

   1077277|00000000||Skellige is a nation of sailors. And where there are sailors, there are pirates. And where there are pirates, there's treasure. Geralt was put on the trail of one such hidden cache of pirate booty during his travels in the isles.<br>
   1077278|00000000||The treasure was, as befits one left by pirates, hidden in a coastal cave. Geralt found it and, following the hallowed law of the sea, kept it for himself.

   1081547|00000000||<br>They say every journey made in the Skellige Isles ends in adventure. And sometimes, that adventure ends in death. Such was the case for the group of adventure-seeking Skelligers who set out in search of treasure in forgotten ruins - which turned out to lie in the hunting grounds of a powerful fiend known as Morvudd.<br><br>The witcher knew there was little room for error in a fight with such a creature. A moment of carelessness and the beast could hypnotize him with its third eye, then tear him to shreds while he remained in a trance. Morvudd was a particularly large individual, so one could presume fast attacks would not prove effective against it - and that its blows would kill anyone not protected with heavy armor or the Quen Sign.

The witcher also learned that Cirilla, his one-time ward, had returned from her long voyage. What's more, she was in danger. The witcher was to seek and find Cirilla - at the emperor's command and Yennefer's behest.

   1058824|00000000||The Whispering Hillock – if the world were not as it is, but as it should be, this name would denote a place of hidden nooks and lovers sharing heartfelt lies in hushed voices. Instead, it stood for danger and terror, a place where wild animals, driven by some mysterious power, had killed many a resident of Downwarren. Geralt agreed to investigate the problem, and soon discovered the animals were controlled by a spirit entrapped within a tree atop the Hillock. The spirit spoke to him in a woman's voice, and claimed to have once been a druid who kept watch over the Velen grove until the Crones murdered her and imprisoned her in the tree. The forces of nature she had once served now protected her from the demonic sisters' further designs. The unfortunate locals had died as collateral damage, for, the spirit attested, nature's wrath is unrestrainable and distinguishes not between unwary innocents and unwelcome ill-wishers.<br><br>The spirit begged Geralt to lift her curse and free her from her torment. In exchange for this help, she promised to rescue the orphans from the swamp clearing, who otherwise would die a cruel death at the Crones' hands.<br>
   1058828|00000000||These whispered words convinced Geralt and, following the spirit's instructions, he lifted the curse, transferring the druid's ghost into the body of a black mare. And so the spirit was set free, and the dark powers afflicting the Whispering Hillock were dispersed.<br>
   1058829|00000000||Yet too much innocent blood had been spilt on the Whispering Hillock. Geralt did not believe the spirit's explanation and destroyed its cursed heart. In doing so he expulsed it from this world for good.<br>

   1061627|00000000||It did not take long for King Radovid of Redania to prove himself a hard and ruthless ruler, one fully deserving to be styled "the Stern." His father, King Vizimir, was murdered when Radovid was quite young, and his mother, Hedwig of Malleore, and a Regency Council ruled in his stead.<br><br>Young Radovid soon seized power in his own right, however, and wrought vengeance on those who had treated him with disrespect. He took to forcing all his potential political opponents to swear allegiance – or face death.<br><br>He waged war not only against Nilfgaard, but also against mages, whom he saw as the root of all evil. Radovid also made every effort to gain control over the Free City of Novigrad, whose fleet and treasury could tip the scales of the ongoing conflict towards Radovid's victory.<br>
   1061628|00000000||Geralt's meeting with Radovid confirmed the rumors circling around the king's mental state. The Redanian king was a dangerous madman trapped in his own world of disturbing visions. This did not make him one jot less intelligent or cunning, however.<br><br>Despite his mental afflictions, the young king was manipulating his opponents like an adroit puppet master.<br>
   1061629|00000000||Radovid burned with particularly intense hostility (first kindled in his earliest childhood days) for the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Rumors spoke of how he had prepared a special torture regimen just for her - and while the two dozen points they mentioned were surely an exaggeration, they accurately conveyed the general scale of his hatred.<br>
   1061630|00000000||The terror of Radovid's reign had led not just his enemies, but also his allies and even his subjects to long for his death.<br>
   1061631|00000000||The phrase "monster in human flesh" fit Radovid the Stern perfectly. Perhaps it was awareness of all the cruel and bestial acts this madman perpetrated that led the witcher to get involved in the plans for his assassination.<br>
   1072934|00000000||Hatred for Philippa Eilhart proved to be Radovid's weakness. He was ready to do anything to capture her - even abandon the safe confines of his flagship.<br>
   1072935|00000000||The plan for luring Radovid out of hiding worked, though not without complications. Irritated by Geralt's typical cheek, Radovid brayed for the witcher's blood, and Geralt only dodge the executioner's axe thanks to the intervention of his co-conspirators.<br><br>Perhaps the  delay this caused was what allowed the ruler to nearly escape his assassins, but in the end he could not cheat fate and died at the hands of Philippa Eilhart, who descended suddenly, a veritable demon of vengeance, to revenge the wrongs he had done her.

   1078210|00000000||My dear papa,<br><br>The wedding's over. It's done. It didn't all go exactly like I'd imagined as a little girl, but, well, you always taught me to make the most of what I've got. We're traveling now, so I'll send this letter as soon as we arrive.<br><br>I'll start with what I'm sure interests you the most - financial matters. As I'm sure you've noticed, a few crowns have gone missing from your lockbox, the cupboard's a couple silver plates lighter, and your jewelry box isn't near as full as it once was. I took it. As my dowry. No doubt much less than you'd have given, had I but found myself a "worthy partner," but, tough, that's life.<br><br>Kurt – or, as you like to call him, "that good-for-nothing bare-arsed lazybones" - is now my husband. And your daughter's precious purity, which you cared about more than her feelings, tears or pleadings - well, it's only a memory now.<br><br>We'll soon arrive at our destination. Naturally, I won't tell you where exactly that is - just in case you get it in your head to come visit. Wherever it is, know your silver will be enough to set up a nice home. That's important - because I'm expecting a child. Are you glad? I doubt it. You always said poor matches only produce mutts and scoundrels. So it's a good thing you'll never have to see this one.<br><br>Your little girl,<br><br>-Jeanette<br>
   1078211|00000000||Geralt derived pleasure from the spirit of headstrong defiance found in Jeanette's letter to her father, and when he searched the place where her boat sank, this pleasure only increased. The woman truly had taken a sizable dowry from her old man.

He was one of the personages whose deeds and decisions shaped the fates of entire kingdoms and peoples.<br><br>What then could he possibly want of a simple witcher?<br>
   1060539|00000000||The emperor clearly and succinctly laid out what he wanted. His daughter and Geralt's ward, Cirilla, was in great danger, for the Wild Hunt was on her trail. Geralt, a superb tracker tied to Emhyr's daughter by the iron bonds of destiny, stood a better chance of finding her than anyone in the world.<br>
   1060544|00000000||Thanks to Geralt's efforts, Emhyr finally had the chance to talk to his daughter face to face after long years of separation. Geralt doesn't know what topic was broached during their conversation, save that Ciri stormed out of it in a visible huff.<br>

According to legend, djinns can grant even the most far-fetched wishes, though they do so very begrudgingly.<br><br>Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings. The mage can then draw on its energy, using it to cast spells without having to call on Power from traditional sources. Only a sparse handful have managed this feat, however, for djinns fight to avoid such a fate with stubborn determination. To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will, one must first weaken it - and that is no easy feat.<br><br>Fighting a djinn is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could never cast with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating the element of air they can summon powerful storms, hurricanes and gales. Luckily, as magic beings they are vulnerable to silver - yet steel will do them no harm.

   1054772|00000000||Novigrad was once famed as a place of tolerance and the rule of law. That is why it attracted mages from all over the world, those persecuted by Radovid and Emhyr alike. The Free City did not live up to their hopes, however, and rather than being a safe haven it became their slaughterhouse.<br><br>Triss Merigold, with whom you, dear reader, are already well acquainted, decided to evacuate all mages still alive to a place far removed from the front lines - Kovir. This was no simple task, and so the sorceress asked the witcher for help. Geralt agreed out of concern for the persecuted mages' fate - and Triss' fate most of all...<br>
   1050586|00000000||When it seemed the mages were finally safe and would set sail for Kovir's snow-covered shores, witch hunters swarmed over the docks and attacked their ship. Like setters who track down hares in even the deepest burrows, they had picked up Triss' trail despite her painstaking efforts to cover it. Luckily, Geralt stood in defense of the mages - as did, surprisingly, Dijkstra, for whom "love thy neighbor" had never been a guiding principle, nor the fate of the mages a matter of particular importance.<br>
   1054775|00000000||With the witch hunters taken care of, the time had come to say goodbye. Though much had bound Geralt and Triss in the past, on this black day, on the blood-slicked planks of the Novigrad harbor, their paths parted. Witcher and sorceress would, true enough, meet again on several occasions, but only ever as friends. Their flight from the Eternal Fire had been the last flicker of the fires of their mutual affection.
   1054776|00000000||With the witch hunters dispatched, the time had come to say goodbye. Geralt sensed his heart accelerate as he realized he might never see Triss again. The thought was unbearable, so before it could overwhelm him, instead of bidding her farewell, he asked her to stay. Though the circumstances on the blood-spattered docks were decidedly unromantic, in that instant all the feelings between Geralt and Triss came rushing back in full force.
   1075118|00000000||Nevertheless, Geralt was forced to abandon his friend in a moment of need, for other, more urgent tasks desperately needed his attention. If he later inquired after the subsequent fate of the mages of Novigrad, I doubt he learned much - the subject became a very sore one for Triss.

According to Avallac'h, his loyalty and sense of right and wrong constituted a weakness that could be used - possibly to tip the scales of the final battle.<br>
   1060472|00000000||As predicted, Ge'els acted out of loyalty to his former king and withdrew support for Eredin once he learned the truth about Auberon's death. This momentous act portended important ramifications for the outcome of the coming  battle.

   1062094|00000000||A witcher without a blade is like a potter without hands, and thus they are always on the lookout for skilled smiths to reforge or repair their deadly limbs. One day Geralt encountered a certain Hattori, a former master swordsmith who had transitioned into the premade edibles trade. He decided to convince the man to give up this dough business and return to his former practice. Little did he know this would be the start of a strange and toilsome adventure involving Skelligers, dumplings, shady ore dealers and, I kid you not, crafting supplies.<br>
   1062095|00000000||During this quest Geralt had to haggle like a fishwife, mix with mafiosos, draw with chalk in the dark and dive into a portside brawl. Most of all, he had to teach a lesson to the man who had squeezed Hattori out of sword making. All this so that Hattori would give up that infernal dumpling scrunching and return to forging blades. From then on our hero could make use of his services, and I sure hope he did so often, for otherwise all that effort was for naught.
   1086983|00000000||To a witcher, a sword is like a lover. He must carress it, care for it, devote some time to it each night. But as with lovers, there are times one comes across a specimen so superior and not one's own that one cannot help but consider replacing the old with the new. Geralt was fully aware of these principles, so when he heard about the legendary swordsmith named Hattori, a tingle ran down his spine, butterflies took flight in his stomach, and he resolved to find the craftsman.

Geralt, however, braved the worst and soon determined the imp was in fact a doppler, one who changed his form more often than other men change their knickers - although, given the hygienic habits of men in this particular district, that was not saying much.<br>
   1051962|00000000||The doppler had no choice but to seek salvation in flight. It seemed Geralt was in for a footrace.<br>
   1051963|00000000||Geralt has a soft heart. Though this does not always move him to mercy, this time it led him to spare the thieving doppler - under the condition that the shapeshifter leave the city at once. After that was settled, Geralt talked to the merchant who had issued the contract and brought the matter of the doppler thief to a close.<br>
   1051964|00000000||To this day I think Geralt did wrong in killing that doppler. In my opinion, his crimes did not match the punishment meted out to him - but, in the end, I am no witcher, and so it is not my place to judge. The merchant Sylvester was, unlike me, thrilled with how the witcher resolved the matter and gave him the promised reward without a second thought.
    576321|00000000||A Novigrad merchant by the name of Sylvester Armello had hung a notice on the Novigrad board asking for help in tracking down a thieving imp. It seemed the merchants' guild was being pestered by a mysterious creature who kept stealing wares from its members stalls. Geralt accepted the job.<br>

    531193|00000000||A certain nobleman asked Geralt for a bit of assistance. He wanted the witcher to accompany him on a stroll through a rather dodgy part of Novigrad. The richman's clothing alone would get him killed in that quarter, so Geralt agreed to help.<br>

    577959|00000000||Geralt spent some time walking through the rich farmlands outside of Novigrad. During one such stroll he happened across the ruins of a tower. Whether out of curiosity or because of the throbbing of his medallion, Geralt decided to investigate. It will surely come as no surprise that this investigation uncovered evidence of a monster's presence...<br>
   1051972|00000000||While in Novigrad, Geralt came across a notice offering a bounty for killing a certain White Lady haunting the fields outside the city. The witcher, who was always in need of coin for... what does he spend his coin on? Armor? Swords? Clips to hold back his hair? At any rate, he was forever short of it, and so accepted the contract.<br>
   1051973|00000000||The White Lady turned out to be a noonwraith. In order to defeat this phantom, Geralt first had to find out what bound it to the abandoned tower and its surrounding fields.<br>

   1059679|00000000||The Free City of Novigrad had known no king's rule for nearly two hundred years – Francis Bedlam surely had this fact in mind when he anointed himself the King of Beggars, a title mocking the pomposity of crowned heads while at the same time stealing a bit of it for itself. Bedlam was a pragmatic man, a trait that was of much use in his profession – managing a network of thieves, beggars, tramps and street urchins that filled every part of the city.<br><br>His contacts gave him access to the freshest gossip and tastiest morsels of information, and the cut he took of his "subjects'" earnings guaranteed a sizeable income for the maintenance of his "court" in the Putrid Grove.<br>
   1059680|00000000||Francis despised fanaticism and prejudice in equal measure, which meant that mages fleeing the witch hunters' pincers often turned to him for protection.

   1050961|00000000||During one of his endless peregrinations Geralt ran into Blueboy Lugos, son of Madman Lugos. Thirsty for adventure and glory, the lad had set off to trek through the mysterious Cave of Dreams. The witcher knew the young warrior was no stranger to courage, but to knowledge, experience, and navigational ability he was a distant relation at best. Fearing the expedition would end in disaster, or at least leave the world one Lugos poorer, he offered his assistance.<br>
   1050962|00000000||According to legend, those foolhardy enough to enter the Cave of Dreams must confront what they fear most. Sometimes the past returns to haunt them - others, the future, prematurely exposed, strikes terror in their hearts. Geralt, Lugos and their companions knew they must fortify their courage to face such a challenge, and so prior to penetrating the cave's bowels put themselves into a trance using a mixture of hallucinogenic herbs. This concoction proved all too potent - even Geralt, who had imbibed more psychoactive substances than most men have milk, soon lost all contact of reality...<br>
   1050964|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partaken of the brain-addling herbs. He expected young Lugos, fresh from the same experience, to bid him a fond farewell. Yet the young warrior had in the meantime discovered Geralt was obliged to help him as repayment for a debt, and yet still had demanded payment for his services. Lugos gave him the promised gold, but it was clear that Geralt, though substantially richer, had lost the respect of Clan Drummond's heir.<br>
   1050965|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partook of the brain-addling herbs. Young Lugos thanked Geralt for his help and cleared him of all debts to Clan Drummond. Geralt returned to his path, swearing that, in the future he would think twice before stepping into Skellige taverns...<br>
   1050993|00000000||Lugos, Jarl of Clan Drummond, might indeed have been as mad as they said, but when the need arose he could calculate as coolly as the sanest of men. When Geralt was brought before him to be tried, he resisted any howls for blood braying in his unhinged mind and instead let the witcher go, thus banking himself a debt of gratitude with a man well able to repay it. He then transferred that credit to his son, sending Geralt off to help Blueboy Lugos traverse the nightmarish Cave of Dreams.
   1051008|00000000||After a bumper crop of wild adventures (many of which, to be frank, I have a hard time believing actually took place), Geralt awoke in the same place where he had earlier partook of the brain-addling herbs. Though not sure himself if the creatures they had battled were truly nightmarish or merely nightmares, Lugos generously rewarded Geralt for his help in defeating them.<br>
   1087235|00000000||While Geralt was curious what secrets lay in the mysterious Cave of Dreams, his interest must have sputtered out before anything became of it. First chance he got, he slipped away from the expedition and returned to his own Path.

It's to hunt. To kill. </i><br>– Jahne Oldak, royal huntsman<br><br>Bears are omnivores – meaning men find a place in their diet beside berries, roots and salmon. When they snack on humans, they most frequently partake of the meat of travelers unwittingly trespassing on their territory, or else that of hunters for whom besting such a creature is a lifelong ambition.<br><br>There are several subspecies of bears – black bears, polar bears and cave bears – which differ from one another in coloring as well as in size and strength. All share one trait in common, however: a near-unmatched ability to kill.<br>
   1077637|00000000||Bears are found far from human habitation, in high mountains or deep woods. They are solitary creatures - and a good thing they are, for defeating a single bear is challenge to anyone, experienced witchers included. Fighting a bear should be avoided, but if it cannot, one should not try to run away – these seemingly clumsy animals can run at an astonishingly high speed, especially if angered.

   1046083|00000000||It turned out Sigi Reuven was none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence and a man well-known to Geralt from past adventures. In an atypical bout of ignorance, Dijksta had no inkling I was involved in the theft of his gold. He treated Geralt's appearance as a fortunate coincidence and offered him a handsome sum in return for help finding his stolen wealth - and the thief who had stolen it. Geralt and Dijkstra thus both wanted to find the exact some person - yours truly - albeit for entirely different reasons. Seizing this bit of good fortune, Geralt accepted the offer and hoped against hope Dijkstra wouldn't catch on to his double dealing.<br>
   1046084|00000000||Like an excavator uncovering an ancient elven masterpiece, Geralt slowly revealed the hidden brilliance of my plan. He discovered we had not barged in directly from the sewers like brain-dead lugs, but had instead struck from the inside, by placing a bomb in one of the tubs' drainpipes.<br><br>Hearing this, Dijkstra summoned his faithful eunuch, Happen, and had him examine the bathhouse guest registry. From it they learned the tub in question had been used that day by a certain Margrave Henckel. Nothing unusual about a margrave giving his corns a bit of a soak - but this particular margrave had shuffled off his mortal coil, corns and all, a few months prior to the break-in. Dijkstra thus tasked Geralt with examining the margrave's residence, in the hope that the witcher would find some trace of the stolen treasure there.<br>
   1046085|00000000||The old spy's intuition did not lead him astray - Margrave Henckel's home truly did prove a source of many interesting and vital clues. Firstly, they discovered that Geralt's doppler acquaintance of yore, Dudu, had been one of the heist's participants. It was he who had disguised himself as Margrave Henckel and placed the bomb in the drainpipe.<br><br>A letter left by Dudu contained further revelations - Ciri had taken part in the heist as well, the stolen gold had ended up in the hands of the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, and I, Dandelion, was now this heinous man's prisoner.<br><br>Geralt clearly needed to confront Menge. The question was how. The cautious guardsman would never agree to a meeting - unless, that is, Geralt had something to offer him, a prize so tempting he'd throw caution to the wind…<br>Triss Merigold, vile sorceress and member of the even viler Lodge of Sorceresses, was willing to offer herself up as irresistible bait for this fanatic hunter of witches, putting her life in danger in order to save Ciri and, I dare say, with a thought in her heart for the art-loving denizens of the North, who otherwise risked being deprived of their most prominent bard.
   1046086|00000000||Caleb Menge took the bait hook, line and sinker, oblivious to Geralt's trickery to the very end. Said end was brought to him by Triss, who stuck a knife in his throat in an emotional outburst understandable from someone who had just been subjected to cruel and unusual torture.<br><br> Luckily, Geralt had by this time already squeezed the information he needed out of Menge. He had learned that I, Dandelion, was rotting in the Temple Isle dungeons, waiting to be transported to Oxenfurt, where I would play my last leading role in a spectacle sure to leave the audience in tears - my own execution. Yet Triss, gods bless her heart, had a plan for preventing this...<br>
   1046087|00000000||The witcher has many virtues, but sadly patience and subtlety are not among them. And so, instead of sticking to the plan, Geralt decided to do things his own way - by slicing down every witch hunter in sword's reach and butchering Caleb Menge before getting any useful information out of him.<br><br>Luckily, however, Geralt did not leave the compound empty-handed. He found instructions among Menge's documents for contacting a mysterious individual who seemed to be directing the Temple Guard's actions. There was a chance this eminence grise, whoever he or she was, knew something about my fate.<br>
   1046088|00000000||Dijkstra was less than satisfied with Geralt's performance as a treasure hunter. Firstly, the witcher had not actually recovered any treasure - just a key found on Menge's body that might open a vault that might contain the treasure, assuming said vault could even be located. Secondly, Dijkstra realized Geralt had been hiding something from him the entire time - the identity of the criminal mastermind responsible for planning the heist (but was this truly so difficult to guess, dear reader? After all, who else but a bard could have planned with such cunning and panache?). The old acquaintances ultimately parted on good terms - but it was clear to both their next meeting might not be so amiable.<br>
   1046089|00000000||Triss Merigold is usually an excruciatingly warm and tender-hearted individual. Yet on this day the witcher discovered the red-haired sorceress has a darker side as well. When Menge's contact refused to cooperate, Triss used her powers to force him to talk by making him feel unbearable pain - and then to ensure he would never speak of what he'd undergone.<br><br>This blood-curdling interrogation informed the witcher that I was imprisoned on Temple Isle, awaiting transport to my execution in Oxenfurt. A dark situation indeed - but Triss had an idea how to keep it from getting any darker...<br>
   1086186|00000000||Fear gripped the witcher's heart as he knocked on the bathhouse doors. He knew that, shortly before I disappeared without a trace, I had been planning to rob Sigi Reuven, one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the North. He would have to inquire about my fate without arousing any suspicions, which was a tall order indeed - for while Geralt may be an excellent witcher, he is one lousy actor.<br>

    588352|00000000||I'll check the area.
    588354|00000000||Thank you. I shall be ever so grateful.
    588344|00000000||Fine, I'll look into it.
    588322|00000000||All right. Time I was on my way.
    588324|00000000||Perhaps… perhaps you'd stay just a bit longer? There's one small favor you might yet do for me.
    588326|00000000||What is it?
    588341|00000000||I put in an order for a few substances from Novigrad. The trader was due to be here yesterday, but has yet to arrive.
    588343|00000000||Could you see what happened? The package is rather important to me.
    588259|00000000||Farewell.
    588252|00000000||Alexander was doing some strange research.
    588279|00000000||One thing's bothering me…
    588281|00000000||What?
    588283|00000000||Anabelle said Alexander was studying diseases. She mentioned "Catriona."
    588284|00000000||You knew this?
    588285|00000000||All the mages knew about it. Alexander was a highly regarded epidemiologist.
    588302|00000000||I would have given anything for an opportunity to study his notes, but he guarded them jealously.
    521479|00000000||Hm, I lifted the curse, so the island's clear. Anabelle's soul is free. Thing is, turned out she's a pesta. Graham's dead.
    521481|00000000||And you failed to notice? You're losing your touch. Be that as it may, Fyke Isle is free of its curse. That's important. I'm almost inclined to say, "good work."
    521483|00000000||And you withheld this news until now? Why? I gave you a xenovox! But the curse - what was its source?
    521485|00000000||The dark spell clung to the spirit of Anabelle, the lord's daughter. To free her and the isle, Graham, her beloved, had to help me.
    521487|00000000||So it ended well.
    513657|00000000||Fyke Isle - I managed to remove the curse.
    513656|00000000||Fyke Isle's free of its curse.
    514320|00000000||A d'yaebl aep arse…

    526269|00000000||Please. N'te dice'en.
    526271|00000000||Are we to leave at last, or shall I just dig my grave here?

   1086294|00000000||During one of his numerous adventures, Geralt got his hands on a map covered with strange markings. He quickly deduced that they  indicated the locations of hidden witcher caches and, intrigued by the chance of discovering long-lost crafting schematics, he set out to find them.
   1086295|00000000||Geralt found all the caches marked on the map and recovered the crafting schematics contained therein. With these in hand, he could add life-saving improvements to his combat gear. He did not know how many more such caches remained undiscovered in the world - but hoped one day he would have the chance to find more.

   1060525|00000000||The name of the King of the Wild Hunt, the identity of the lord of nightmares, the being behind the frightful mask – this long remained unknown. Over time, however, scraps of information gradually coalesced into a full likeness of our foe – but did nothing to detract from the terror he inspired.<br><br>The Wild Hunt was in truth an elite cavalry brigade from the world of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, and was commanded by their ambitious and ruthless king, Eredin Bréacc Glas. He would travel via secret paths through the cold emptiness between his world from ours to capture victims and take them back to his homeland as slaves.<br><br>The current object of his Hunt was Cirilla, whose power he wanted to harness for his own uses. The only obstacle in his path - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1060531|00000000||Ciri was able to shed a bit of light on the commander of the Wild Hunt's motivations. The threat of annihilation hung over the Aen Elle homeland. Eredin, a warrior and a conqueror by nature, decided to solve this problem in the simplest possible way - by seizing our world. The key to doing so? Ciri's power, which would allow him to open the gates to a full-scale invasion.<br>
   1060530|00000000||Trusting in the strength of his magic and the skill of his Riders, Eredin boldly launched a frontal assault on Kaer Morhen. Despite the defenders' noble sacrifices, he came close to victory. Only Ciri's unleashed power forced Eredin to fall back. It was clear, however, that he would learn from this defeat and that his next attack would be insurmountable.<br>
   1060532|00000000||According to Avallac'h, it was Eredin who bore responsibility for the death of Auberon Murcetach, the previous ruler of the Aen Elle. Revealing this fact would certainly not earn him friends and popularity amongst the Alder Folk.<br>
   1060534|00000000||Eredin's last battle is worthy of a poem - nay, an epic - all to itself, yet this is neither the time nor the place to pen it. To be brief, on that fateful day the cruel King of the Hunt seemed unstoppable and tore asunder all who dared stand in his way - until, that is, his way led him smack into Geralt of Rivia. The two expert fighters faced off in a last skirmish on the ghastly deck of the Naglfar. The fight was long and difficult, but the witcher's blade struck true in the end, cutting down Eredin's dreams of power and conquest.<br><br>So died Eredin Bréacc Glas, King of the Wild Hunt.

    400392|00000000||Shortly after arriving in Skellige Geralt received a letter from his old friend, the jarl Crach an Craite, lord of Kaer Trolde castle. It turned out the witcher was not the only one searching for lost loved ones. Crach's son, Hjalmar, whose famed courage pushed him to feats only a madman would dare, had disappeared after sailing off to the island of Undvik to prove his strength against the Ice Giant. This beast had slept for centuries in the frozen bowels of the island, forgotten to men - until one day he awoke and began to murder and destroy. Hjalmar wanted to defeat the Giant and win back the island for the few left alive who had once called it home - at the same time winning everlasting fame for himself. Yet something must not have gone as the young an Craite had planned, for weeks had passed since his departure and he still had not returned. It became clear that someone would have to face the danger lurking on Undvik and survive, returning to tell Crach of the fate of his first-born son. And though the warriors of Skellige are famed for their courage and skill in battle, Crach knew there was only one man who stood a chance against such a monster - Geralt of Rivia.

    460201|00000000||On the coast of Ard Skellig Geralt ran into a young warrior - well, he stopped running before he hit the young man, but I believe you get my drift, dear reader - at any rate, the point of my story was not that he ran up to (not into!) this said warrior, but that the warrior was besieged by pirates at the time. Geralt helped him fight off his attackers and listened (with only a slight amount of witcher impatience) to his story, which was as follows: the man's sister had been kidnapped by pirates (not unlike the ones he had just faced), and he was determined to track her down, even if it meant searching all the isles in the Skellige archipelago. He thanked Geralt for his help in dealing with one of what would surely be many patches of pirate trouble and continued on his path.<br>
   1051168|00000000||While visiting Freya's temple on the isle of Hindarsfjall Geralt met a woman named Kurisu who told him how she had managed to escape the clutches of a band of ruthless pirates who had kidnapped her. Who would have imagined a frame so slender could hold such bravery? Perhaps one day I shall write a ballad about her - "Kurisu, Kurisu, full of courage and daring-do..."

   1053117|00000000||Those on the Continent worship the gods by praying, burning incense and making offerings. In Skellige, all these are practiced, but the islanders consider the best way of honoring the gods to be risking one's life while performing feats of bravery. A favorite way to do this? Taking part in the Heroes' Dash, a race full of strong emotions and frightening dangers sure to make the goddess smile.<br><br>Geralt is not the most pious of fellows, but the prize on offer for the race's winner (as well as the chance to test Roach's speed against the best Skellige mounts) convinced him to join in.<br>
   1053119|00000000||There he faced the winner of last year's Dash: Astrid the Vipress. Though she was as vast and dangerous as her name-snake, even she was unable to beat the witcher. Geralt's victory brought glory to him and joy to the goddess - with a handsome prize making it all the sweeter.

   1048579|00000000||What does one expect to find inside an abandoned country manor? Dusty crockery. Moth-eaten doilies. A moldy trophy buck, perhaps, if its inhabitants trod on the wild side. Certainly not the most wanted man north or south of the Yaruga. Yet that, dear reader, is exactly who Geralt found when he entered such a manor in Lindenvale. The assassin of kings himself, Geralt's old acquaintance, his sometime friend and sometime enemy: Letho. He was hiding there from bounty hunters out for his scalp. Geralt, now fully able to remember how Letho and two of his colleagues once saved Yennefer's life, could not refuse him help.<br>
   1048580|00000000||What Letho did next proved he was both clever and fearless. In order to get rid of the bounty hunters breathing down his neck once and for all, he took a crossbow bolt to the chest and faked his own death. This caught Geralt by surprise, but he improvised splendidly. Convinced Letho was dead, Vester and his men rode off to spread the news far and wide. Letho could now simply lie low for a spell and wait for the world to forget about him...<br>
   1048581|00000000||What Letho did next proved he was both clever and fearless. In order to get rid of the bounty hunters breathing down his neck once and for all, he took a crossbow bolt to the chest and faked his own death. This caught Geralt by surprise, and sadly the witcher doesn't always handle surprises with much tact or subtlety. Instead, he usually does what he did this time, namely murder all and sundry within sword's reach. There were thus no witnesses to spread the false news of Letho's death, and the wanted man was right back where he started.<br>
   1048641|00000000||Geralt proposed that his old acquaintance seek shelter at Kaer Morhen. Letho hesitated, but in the end accepted the offer.
   1048642|00000000||Somewhere along the way Geralt parted with Letho. To this day no one knows if he did this on purpose or merely got lost, but one thing is certain - the two witchers' paths never crossed again.<br>
   1092036|00000000||While traversing the inhospitable lands of Velen, Geralt came across an abandoned farming estate. Upon entering the estate's farmhouse, he discovered that, though seemingly uninhabited, it was crammed full of deadly traps.

   1082624|00000000||<i>It just me, or is that gargoyle ogling us?</i><br>– Lara Estevann, burglar from Loc Muinne<br><br>Gargoyles are stone statues brought to life by magic in order to guard mages' laboratories and lairs from intruders. Their appearance alone has scared off more than one prospective burglar. Those who do not take fright at the sight of these horned and winged monstrosities usually die shortly thereafter, torn to shreds by stony claws.<br>
   1082625|00000000||Gargoyles are extremely dangerous opponents. Etched out of granite or marble, they are able to withstand tremendous amounts of damage and exhibit superhuman strength. One blow dealt from their boulder-like fists will crush even a man clad in heavy armor. Not even those out of reach of a gargoyle's arms can feel safe, for they are able to through hunks of stone with deadly precision.<br><br>Due to gargoyles' considerable size and weight, the Aard Sign does nothing against them. As beings made of stone, they feel no pain from fire, meaning the Igni Sign is worthless against them, as are weapons meant to cause bleeding or poisoning. It is a witcher's good fortune that they also have a few weaknesses: they feel the sting of a silver blade and are hurt by dimeritium bombs, which disrupt the workings of the magic spell which gives them life.

   1078416|00000000||A true master armorer is a rare bird indeed, so we can honestly speak of delight sparking in Geralt's heart when he first met Yoana. Yet before she could forge him new armor, she was in need of some assistance. The witcher would have to hunt down an archgriffin and extract from it some ingredients required for the forging of the finest armors.<br>
   1078417|00000000||An archgriffin is not a foe to be taken lightly, a fact Geralt knew full well. Yet in the end he was able to defeat the beast and took from it not just the ingredients for the armorer, but also a trophy he could turn in to the quartermaster of Crow's Perch for a reward.

   1002192|00000000||As you recall, the self-proclaimed baron of Velen had asked Geralt to find his missing family. And so, ever a man of his word, find them he did. Tamara, the baron's daughter, he found in Oxenfurt, where she had joined the witch hunters. As for Anna, the baron's wife, she had been kidnapped by the Crones and made their slave, in fulfillment of a bargain she had struck with them earlier. Hearing this, the baron swore to free Anna, with or without the witcher's help, and set off to the place in the bog where Geralt had seen his wife.<br>
   1002193|00000000||Geralt decided to help the baron and went with him into the bog. There they ran into unexpected company: Tamara, accompanied by a band of witch hunters, had also ventured out in search of Anna.<br>They joined forces and, in the end, Anna was found, but, sadly, her mind was lost for good. Driven near mad himself with grief, the baron swore he would take his addled wife away from Velen and search the whole world for someone able to help her. As for Tamara, she and the witch hunters returned to Novigrad. And then... well, dear reader, the ultimate fate of the baron and his family is a tale for another time.
   1002194|00000000||Geralt decided to help the baron and ventured with him into the bog. There they happened upon unexpected company - Tamara and a band of witch hunters, who had also set out in search of Anna.<br>They joined forces and found Anna, sadly turned into a terrible beast by a curse the Crones had cast. Geralt decided he would try to lift the curse and went to Johnny, the godling, for help.<br>
   1002195|00000000||And Johnny, as always, proved very helpful indeed. He revealed to Geralt that the Crones worked their magic in the basement of the hut with the tapestry. When Geralt and Graden descended into the basement, they found a collection of dolls with various items attached to them. They tried to reverse the curse by removing the doll that represented Anna, but their efforts ended in catastrophe - Anna burst into flames and died. Tamara returned to Oxenfurt following her mother's death, her spirits crushed. The baron, in no less foul a mood, went back to Crow's Perch. Geralt watched him walk away, wondering if he would ever see the man again.<br>

   1002197|00000000||In the end, Geralt decided he would look in on the baron. When he reached Crow's Perch, he inquired after the man but was saddened to learn he was dead. The lord of Velen had hanged himself, ending his reign and his sorrow.
   1087105|00000000||In the end, the baron had only his own men to help him in his task. Geralt must have decided he had already done plenty by finding Anna and didn't want any more to do with the Crones than was absolutely necessary.<br><br>The witcher never saw the baron again. Perhaps the upstart lord of Velen died in the swamps while trying to find his wife - or perhaps he wanders there still to this day...

   1049776|00000000||While muddling around the well-shaded village of Blackbough, Geralt happened across a notice. It stated a hunter named Niellen was looking for any help he could get in finding his wife, who had disappeared in the nearby woods a few days earlier. Geralt, already deep in a search-and-rescue vein, decided to help find the woman.<br>
   1049788|00000000||While Geralt was combing the woods for signs of the missing woman, he came across Margaret, Hanna's sister. The woman asked the witcher to abandon his search and tell Niellen his wife was dead. Margaret thought the sooner Niellen came to terms with his loss, the sooner he would be able to put it behind him and start living his life. Geralt decided this made sense and agreed.<br>
   1049777|00000000||The story of Hanna's disappearance had a tragic end. It turned out she had been killed by her own husband. He did not do this on purpose, however. Afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, he would hide in the forest during his transformations in order to protect his friends and loved ones.<br><br>Hanna's sister Margaret knew this secret, and had one of her one - she was in love with Niellen and fiercely jealous of Hanna's life with him. She decided to take Hanna into the woods to watch her husband's transformation, hoping she'd then abandon him in disgust. Sadly, Hanna was careless enough to draw the werewolf's attention. Margaret was able to escape, but her sister was not so lucky. Niellen, transformed into a bloodthirsty beast, slaughtered the love of his life with his own hands.<br>

Yet having mastered all challengers in this arena, he had no choice but to find another in which to garner more laurels.

    550419|00000000||A mysterious fog that killed all who ventured into it had arisen near the village of Downwarren - inconveniently close to where peat was being dug. Geralt decided to investigate this murderous mist and see if he couldn't put a stop to it.<br>
   1051935|00000000||Near the village called Downwarren, Geralt came across a man who dug peat for a living. One glance was enough to know something was ailing the poor fellow. He warned the witcher about a strangling fog which had sprung up in the nearby swamp. The man's story convinced Geralt a monster was at work and so he decided to look into the matter.<br>
   1051936|00000000||Geralt's investigation took him to the very heart of the swamp. As he was walking an exceptionally hideous foglet suddenly jumped out at him from an unusually thick patch of fog. The monster was old and strong, making defeating of it no easy labor. Geralt managed the task, however, and a few moments after the foglet breathed its last, the poisonous fog dispersed and the witcher could at last fill his lungs safely.<br>
   1051937|00000000||While traversing an unpleasant swamp near the village of Downwarren, Geralt came across some very unusual tracks. His instincts told him they might have been left by a monster, so he decided to take a closer look...<br>
   1051938|00000000||Hoping to find someone who would offer him a reward, Geralt went to Downwarren. A peat digger residing in that village was grateful Geralt had enabled a return to his labors and so handed the witcher some coin.
   1051939|00000000||Hoping to find someone who would offer him a reward, Geralt went to Downwarren. A peat digger residing there was grateful to the witcher for enabling him to return to his labors and promised the witcher a generous reward - if he could stand to wait a few days while he gathered more funds. Geralt agreed, and in return for his patience received a purse full of gold crowns.

   1002633|00000000||Geralt knew he could only defeat Eredin with the help of mages and on his own terms. Since the King of the Wild Hunt was traveling on the Naglfar, the spectral vessel known from Skellige legend, somewhere between worlds, our heroes had to summon him back and somehow cut off his escape route. Such a feat could only be performed by a group of mages acting in concert and aided by a legendary elven artifact - the Sunstone.<br>
   1002634|00000000||The emperor's flagship was anchored in Skellige's waters when Geralt arrived. His Imperial Majesty would preside over the battle in person - but more important to Geralt was the prisoner he held on his ship, the Nilfgaardian sorceress Fringilla Vigo, whose aid could turn the tide of Ciri's defense. Geralt thus asked the Emhyr to lend him his captive sorceress. Though Fringilla was a suspected traitor, Emhyr agreed.<br>
   1002635|00000000||Geralt overcame countless obstacles and found the Sunstone - a feat which, to give credit where it's due, would have been impossible without the help of Philippa Eilhart. Everyone knew what this meant: the preparations for the great battle against the Wild Hunt had come to an end, and what would follow their activation of the Sunstone would determine the fate of the world.

Within the colony their duty lies in building nests and cocoons, acquiring food and caring for eggs and larvae. When threatened they will summon warriors to aid them, yet if forced to defend themselves they will – and do so surprisingly well.<br>
   1077739|00000000||Endrega workers are most often found traveling in groups of half-dozen or more members. They move slowly, yet when attacking, they are capable of covering the distance to their victim in the blink of an eye. Like all of their kind, endrega workers are highly venomous. Their bite is toxic, as are any wounds dealt by the bony growths on the ends of their limbs. They can also spew acid to great effect from a distance of several paces. Their usual tactic is to surround their enemy and attack him from several sides at once. Like all insectoids they do not suffer particularly from bleeding, yet are caused great harm by insectoid oil.

A well-treated pet repays his owner with loyalty and trust, whereas an ill-treated one repays this treatment in kind as well, meeting yells with barks and kicks with bites. Since there is an abundance of bad men, so, too, is there an abundance of bad dogs. Most dangerous of all are the vagrant mutts who have lost all respect for men and developed a taste for blood and carrion.<br>
   1077602|00000000||Dogs usually attack in packs, choosing isolated victims, especially ones in whom they sense some kind of weakness. Packs of rabid dogs usually only dare attack children, drunkards, the elderly and cripples.

   1059648|00000000||A joke circulating through the back alleys and seedy taverns of Novigrad claimed the dwarf Carlo Varese, one of the four leading lights of the local criminal strata, was, in his own way, a fierce proponent of racial coexistence. He applied this principle in a rather selective fashion, however.<br><br>Cleaver firmly felt that he personally had every right, as an assimilated inhabitant of the city of Novigrad, to run his own business. Anyone who had a problem with the way he ran it or the nature of its dealings, be he dwarf, human or halfling, revealed himself as a vile racist. The only fitting thing to do with such scum?

   1061133|00000000||After Guthlaf, trusted seneschal to the an Craite jarls, passed away a portion of his duties were taken over by the jarl's cupbearer, Arnvald. This elderly Skelliger did not possess the far-reaching authority of his predecessor, but still had managed to make himself irreplaceable in his few years in the position.<br><br>His purview included not only stocking the larders and cellars of Kaer Trolde but also seeing to the needs of the keep's inhabitants, as well as the guests that visited it during feasts and other important ceremonies.<br>
   1061134|00000000||That is why his betrayal could not have come as a greater surprise. When caught, Arnvald confessed to his role in the murderous conspiracy, revealing his patron as well as his long-seething hatred for Clan an Craite.<br>
   1061135|00000000||That is why his betrayal could not have come as a greater surprise. His motivations, however, remained a secret that he took to his grave, for he died while trying to escape, killed on his patron's orders.

   1083602|00000000||Geralt needed to face Eredin, but could only hope to beat him with the help of friends. The Wild Hunt would only be defeated with magic of the extraordinarily powerful kind. So Triss and Yen set out to reassemble the Lodge of Sorceresses. Avallac'h, too, began to lay plans of his own.
   1083603|00000000||The elven Sage decided to erode the King of the Hunt's support in his own realm. With Geralt in tow, he ventured through several worlds to the city of Tir nà Lia, where they found Eredin's viceroy, Ge'els.<br><br>Ge’els had been a loyal subject of the Alder Folk's previous king. When he learned Eredin was a regicide, he agreed to help Avallac'h and Geralt defeat the usurper.

   1051210|00000000||News that Ciri and Geralt had defeated and killed Imlerith reached Avallac'h at once. I don't know how this happened, exactly, save perhaps that quickly learning of such things is the very essence of being a "Sage."<br><br>At any rate, a wild notion possessed him. What if they could now sway Ge'els, one of Eredin's most powerful allies? What if they could bring him over to their side? A key general and advisor, Ge'els was the individual Eredin relied on for reinforcements. For his plan to work, he would need a dreamer, so Triss pointed him towards Corinne Tilly in Novigrad. Thus, by the time Geralt and Ciri rode into town, everything had been arranged. Now all they needed was Ge'els...<br><br>To reach him, Avallac'h and Geralt would need to travel to the land of the Aen Elle, a voyage that would involve interdimensional travel, which in turn meant a whole lot of teleporting. Geralt vomited a little in his mouth and prepared to face the music.<br>
   1051894|00000000||Ah, what I wouldn't give to see with my own eyes what Geralt saw in the worlds he traversed. Yet most intriguing of all seemed the world of the Aen Elle, the end point of Geralt's and Avallac'h's journey. To behold the glories of this ancient elven civilization… but alas, fate granted this privilege not to a poet but to a witcher, who returned not with paeans to the distant world's beauty, but with a general of the Wild Hunt - one Ge'els. I must be fair, however, and state that the general proved useful.<br><br>Avallac'h decided to bet all on the ace he had tucked up his sleeve. With the help of the dreamer Corinne Tilly, he proved to Ge'els that Eredin had killed Auberon, the erstwhile king of the Aen Elle and the object of Ge'els' undying devotion.<br><br>Confronted by this revelation, Ge'els could hardly return to business as usual. He struggled internally for some moments before revealing the one way Geralt and friends could hope to defeat Eredin and company. They would have to battle Eredin and the Hunt in their own world and on their own terms. The first step - to use the Sunstone to summon the Naglfar. A plan of action was devised - Geralt, Ciri, the sorceresses and Avallac'h would sail to Skellige to find the stone, while Zoltan and I would stay behind in Novigrad to keep the hearth fires burning and secure our friends' return.
   1051893|00000000||An unpleasant surprise was in store for Geralt after he departed the Ddiddiwedht Desert: Avallac'h was no longer with him. The Sage had warned him that something of the sort might happen, but Geralt had quietly hoped this would not be the case. His hopes had been misplaced, and now the witcher would have to stumble blindly and alone as he searched for the passage to the next world.<br>

Knowing the witcher, however, knowledge of Morvran's rank and status would not have made much difference.<br>
   1059802|00000000||The witcher encountered Voorhis again some time later in Novigrad. There the Nilfgaardian general was taking advantage of the city's neutral status to enjoy the company of Baroness Louisa la Valette.<br>

   1074004|00000000||The borrower predictably turned out to be a swindler. The only way for Geralt to collect on his ill-considered loan was to kill the man.

She made a desperate decision and, in the blink of an eye, teleported herself next to the monster and swiftly cut off its head.<br><br>This decision had consequences, however: Eredin could sense whenever Ciri used her powers, meaning that even that short moment - in which she revealed the strength lying dormant inside her - was enough to alert the Wild Hunt. Wanting to save the area and her newfound friends from the destruction that would inevitably follow in the Red Riders' wake, Ciri quickly abandoned Crow's Perch and made her way to Novigrad, where she hoped to find Yennefer.

Born of dead, unwanted babies discarded without a proper burial, their appearance is that of a partially-decayed fetus, their unformed flesh twisted with hate, fear and malice. These hideous creatures feed on the blood of pregnant women, driven by a mad hunger that most often leads to their victim's death.<br>
   1077280|00000000||A botchling will emerge from its lair at night to lurk by the bedside of an expectant mother, draining her strength and that of her unborn progeny as she sleeps. A woman thus beleaguered first suffers from troubling dreams, then fever, delirium and a general weakening of the flesh. After a few such nights she is enfeebled and unable to defend herself - it is then the botchling attacks directly, sinking its long, sharp fangs into her body and drinking of her blood until mother and fetus perish together.<br><br>A botchling stands around a foot and a half in height, but, when threatened and if gorged with blood, it can change form. At such times it grows into a deformed man, hunched over and striding, ape-like, on its forearms. Stronger and fiercer after this alteration, it hurls itself into direct, physical combat, gnashing at its opponent or attacking him with sharp claws.<br><br>A botchling's curse can be lifted by transforming it into a lubberkin - a guardian spirit of the hearth that watches over the family it never knew in the house it never could call home.

   1074092|00000000||Geralt discovered that the nekkers dwelling in the nearby wood were led by a particularly strong nekker warrior. Its presence had made the others more aggressive and daring. The only way to solve this problem was to enter the nekkers' lair and kill their leader.<br>

   1061120|00000000||Though Madman Lugos, jarl of Clan Drummond, was nothing special in terms of size or strength, most men in the isles still stepped aside when they saw him coming. Eternally feuding with his neighbors, Lugos had a reputation for a furious and violent temper and managed to get into shouting matches with even the usually-placid Donar an Hindar.<br><br>Yet Lugos' biggest rival was Crach an Craite, whom he accused of stealing part of his domain (which in his reckoning encompassed all of Ard Skellig). The clans' quarrel went back hundreds of years and there was nothing to indicate it would end while these two fierce enemies lived. Lugos hated Crach with a passion dampened only by the laws of Skellige and the disproportionate balance of power between the two clans.<br>
   1061121|00000000||Seeing his own son die and Crach an Craite's child take the throne of Skellige proved too much for Lugos to bear. Enraged and embittered, he refused to listen to reason and attacked the witcher, thus picking a fight that could only end one way.

   1086959|00000000||<br>This ancient foglet proved particularly adept in the art of forming illusions. Only a professional monster slayer skilled with Signs and swords could best such a foe. Luckily, Geralt fit that description perfectly.

   1081436|00000000||The monster haunting the peat bogs of Velen turned out to be an ancient foglet. These are exceptionally long-lived creatures - some have even dwelt on this earth for over two hundred years, growing stronger and stronger all the while. Blows dealt by foglets of such an age carry so much power blocking them is out of the question. These foglets possess the ability to move extremely quickly, and not even Yrden can slow them down. Furthermore, they can meld completely into the mist, then suddenly rematerialize to strike from behind. Wearing heavy armor or making good use of the Quen Sign is highly recommended.

   1083242|00000000||Yennefer's suspicions proved true - Ciri had indeed appeared in Skellige. She had arrived from another world, together with a masked mage. She and the mage had then fought the Wild Hunt, before fleeing through portals that carried them to Velen.<br><br>There, one trail ended and another began. A long time later the Wild Hunt had reappeared on the isle of Hindarsfjall. This could mean Ciri had returned to Skellige once more.

   1053608|00000000||While wallowing in the Bits, Novigrad's worst and most notorious slum, the witcher took a contract on a monster committing horrendous murders under the cover of darkness. At the time, he never suspected that a story starting in the gutter would end in a luxurious manor.<br>
   1053619|00000000||It turned out the monster was an ekimmara, but that was of minor importance. What was truly interesting was that Lambert was hunting the creature as well. And most interesting of all was that he was doing so in order to get to the leader of a group of assassins who had killed his friend. One by one our heroes hunted down the members of the group until they finally found their boss - Jad Karadin.<br>
   1053625|00000000||In the end, Lambert and Geralt found this Jad Karadin. The man was living in the lap of luxury and would have blended in perfectly amongst the cream of Novigrad's crop - had he not been a witcher from the Cat School. Quite unexpectedly, Karadin welcomed them into his home and introduced them to his wife, Leticia, and his two adopted children.<br><br>Over the course of their conversation, Karadin tried to do the impossible: convince two trained killers bent on his death to let him live. He said he was a changed man and had sworn off his assassin ways. Yet his repentance had come too late, and he paid for his past crimes with his own blood.<br>
   1053626|00000000||In the end, Lambert and Geralt found this Jad Karadin. When they did, they were in for some serious surprises. The man was in fact a retired witcher, now living in the lap of luxury, surrounded by his beautiful... family? But how? While there was nothing surprising about his wife, Leticia, the last thing Geralt expected to find in the home of a sterile witcher were two bright-eyed children. It turned out the kids were adopted, and Karadin swore he loved them as if they were his own. Karadin convinced the witchers he had changed for the better and set aside his killing ways. Hearing this, Geralt told Lambert to abandon his plans for vengeance. Did he do right? That, dear reader, is not something a chronicler scribbling the tale down in a comfortable alcove with the benefit of hindsight is in a position to judge.
   1071181|00000000||Near the Novigrad docks Geralt ran into his old brother at arms, Lambert. Geralt's surprise grew when he realized the ekimmara they both were hunting was not the chief reason for Lambert's presence in the city. But before they could sit down for a heartfelt chat, the two witchers had to deal with their dishonest contractor. How many times will men try to cheat witchers out of honest pay for honest work before they learn...? <br> That taken care of, Geralt could now talk to Lambert. It turned out he was hunting the people responsible for the death of his friend, Aiden, a witcher from the Cat School. Lambert had learned Aiden had been murdered by a gang of hired thugs led by a man named Jad Karadin. Geralt decided to help Lambert and the two set off on a path to revenge.<br>
   1087106|00000000||Though the contract had seemed fascinating at first, Geralt quickly lost interest. He never found out what sort of mysterious monster had been prowling the streets of Novigrad at night.
   1087107|00000000||Though resolving this matter was of the utmost importance to Lambert, Geralt soon lost interest in it completely. He never found Jad Karadin.

It starts with Geralt taking a bath, disproving the theory that witchers neglect personal hygiene. But as he's bathing, he is brusquely interrupted by Yennefer - does she ever interrupt in any other way? She reminds him that he was supposed to train with Ciri. What could our hero do but bid the sorceress farewell and descend into the courtyard of the fortress. Little did he know this would mark the start of a great adventure.<br>
   1050731|00000000||As it turned out, all that happened at Kaer Morhen was but a dream… The kind that wakes even witchers, screaming, a cold sweat on their brow. Geralt crouched by the fire and surveyed the land, a land ravaged by war, signs of battle stretching to the horizon. But he had not chosen this campsite for its view - Yennefer's trail had brought him there…

   1051925|00000000||In the village of Lindenvale Geralt came across a highly unusual contract. A certain hunter was worried by some strange tracks he had found in the woods and sought someone who could help him determine to whom - or to what - they belonged.<br>
   1051926|00000000||In the village of Lindenvale Geralt came across tracks which indicated a beast of considerable size prowled the area. As a declared defender of mankind against monsters, he decided to investigate the matter.<br>
   1051929|00000000||The tracks took the witcher straight to a fiend's lair. Geralt quickly determined, however, that this monster was not the true threat to the local populace - not compared to what had killed it. That's right, something had beaten him to his initial task and slain the fiend, and he suspected this something was a chort attacking in an act of territorial warfare. Geralt had no other choice but to lure this powerful monster to him and attempt to slay it.<br>
   1051930|00000000||Geralt fought long and hard against the chort and in the end emerged victorious. After taking a trophy as proof of his deed, he went to Lindenvale and collected the reward promised by the hunter.

And I did some damned fine trading along the way - packed my chest so full of silver and other treasures that my back almost snapped when I was setting it on the wagon.<br><br>If everything goes as planned, I'll be home by tomorrow around sunset. I'll owe the goddess mightily for taking such care of me!<br>
   1078237|00000000||Perhaps Freya judged the offering inadequate, or perhaps she had always scorned the merchant - one way or the other, the poor fellow did not manage to make it home alive. Geralt took custody of his abandoned possessions, though I doubt the thought entered his head to thank the goddess for this.
   1086670|00000000||Geralt found a crumpled note on the body of an itinerant merchant. Intrigued, he decided to examine it more closely.

Though well-rotten carrion is their food of choice, they will not turn up their noses at fresh meat, man flesh included.<br>
   1077905|00000000||When they spy a potential victim, erynias, like harpies or shishigas, will try to make full use of the strength of their numbers and their ability to control the skies. They will circle above their prey then attack from several directions at once, striking with razor-shark talons and tearing their targets to shreds.<br><br>While attacking they aim for the neck, eyes and other vital organs, often causing their prey to bleed to death as a result. In this way a small flock of erynias is able to make quick work of larger and better-armed victims, who often are not able to defend themselves effectively from several opponents attacking at once.

There is one silver lining to this sad fact, however: the beasts living there must compete fiercely for hunting territory, meaning monsters often end up killing other monsters.

Each one of its blows was enough to kill - only heavy armor or the Quen Sign could protect one from mortal damage. Particularly to be avoided was its charge - and whenever possible, the monster was best attacked from the side.

   1046079|00000000||The guards at the castle gate were clearly not happy to see Geralt. They denied him entry, growling a few threats as they sent him on his way. However, the witcher had to talk to the Bloody Baron, so he set out to find another way into Crow's Perch.<br>
   1046080|00000000||Surprisingly, Geralt got some help from a villager he met near the castle. The old man directed the witcher to the source of an old well, claiming Geralt would find a way into Crow's Perch from there.<br>
   1046081|00000000||Geralt found his meeting with the Bloody Baron quite peculiar, and the baron himself not so bloody at all. Or did it just seem so? In any case, it turned out Ciri had indeed visited Crow's Perch some time past, but further information about her was only available for a price.<br>
   1046078|00000000||Nilfgaard's agent had determined Ciri had stayed with the baron - the self-proclaimed ruler of Velen. This man was known for his violent temper and three-mile-long cruel streak, hence his moniker: the Bloody Baron. Geralt, however, was not one to be frightened by nicknames, least of all those taken from bodily fluids, and so made his way to Crow's Perch, the baron's seat, to ask about Cirilla.<br>

   1054993|00000000||Geralt stopped by a certain Novigrad book merchant whose owner recognized him at once. He said someone had left a book with him a long time ago with instructions to give it to Geralt if he ever got the chance. This naturally piqued the witcher's curiosity. Sadly, the book dealer did not know the book's exact present location, only that it had a red cover and that Geralt should look for it in his stacks of dusty tomes and manuscripts.<br>
   1054994|00000000||Geralt found the book and, inside it, a letter from someone he had once known. Though he gave no outward sign of it, this filled him with touching recollections of old times. To this day I don't know who the old friend was nor what he had written in the letter - and that's a shame, for judging by Geralt's behavior, therein lies a very interesting tale...

Nevertheless, that was the only appellation the witcher knew for His Imperial Highness' nose to the ground in Velen.<br><br>After asking around, Geralt learned a "Hendrik" lived in the village of Heatherton.<br>
   1058815|00000000||Sadly, Geralt arrived too late. The village had been ravaged, its inhabitants slaughtered and Hendrik's service to Nilfgaard terminated in a most violent and disturbing manner.<br>
   1058816|00000000||Yet the agent showed such determination before he died that Vattier de Rideaux, chief of the imperial spy corps, surely beamed with pride if he ever heard of it. Despite undergoing horrific tortures, Hendrik preferred to die in agony rather than reveal where he hid his reports.

   1083240|00000000||As Yennefer of Vengerberg told it, there had been a magic explosion in Skellige. It had destroyed a vast swathe of primeval forest and was related somehow to Ciri's reappearance. Geralt set out for the Isles to join the sorceress and seek further clues of Ciri's whereabouts.
   1083241|00000000||As it turned out, the druid Ermion had no intention of letting the sorceress examine the destroyed woods. Geralt and Yennefer sought out Jarl Crach an Craite, who helped them break down the druid's resolve.

To know what forest paths deer are like to trod, to know in what muck boars will wallow, to guess when a hare will emerge from its burrow - that is half the battle.<br><br>What most men do not know is that some monsters also possess such knowledge. For example, a royal wyvern from Velen had learned the danger of exposing itself to human eyes and arrows by flying high to pick out its prey from afar. Instead, it would lurk by the roadside and wait for military transports. In this way it grew fat on salted pork and beer, expanding until it resembled a dragon more than other, lesser members of its own kind.<br><br>The witcher thus knew this beast would be much stronger and more resilient than a normal wyvern. Even one blow from it could kill - which is why he would need to avoid its charge at all costs. He would also be wise to force it to the ground with his crossbow or a bomb whenever it tried to fly into the air and hurtle down in a deadly dive.

Both groups agree, however, on what happens to spirits who, for one reason or another, remain in our world after their body breathes its last: they transform into wraiths. To hear their mournful howls, one can surmise this is not a fate to be envied.<br>
   1077838|00000000||Wraiths are usually encountered at night, near cemeteries, catacombs and other such burial places, or else near the places that were important to them in life: abandoned homes, crumbling castles or forgotten bridges.<br><br>Wraiths suffer endless, indescribable pain. Filled with anger and a sense of having been wronged, they both envy the living and brim with overwhelming hatred for them. Like other specters, they are immaterial, meaning they are not harmed by fire, poison or weapons designed to provoke bleeding. <br><br>Wraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. One can, however, force them to reassume a physical presence by trapping them with the Yrden Sign or by hitting them with slivers from a Moon Dust bomb. As with any such ghostly being, one should fight them using silver swords, preferably ones smeared with a thick coat of specter oil. Note as well that wraiths are particularly dangerous on moonless nights.

    548411|00000000||Geralt spent some time rutting around in the dank alleyways of Novigrad and at one point came upon the body of a mysterious man.

   1049219|00000000||Wind-whipped and rain-battered, Geralt stumbled into a small village on the coast of An Skellig. The foul weather, he learned, had cursed this spot ever since a mysterious tower appeared one morning out of thin air, as if placed by an invisible giant's hand. Intrigued, Geralt decided to investigate.<br>
   1049220|00000000||The tower, as one might have predicted, was endowed with magic. To be precise, it was equipped with a Defensive Regulatory Magicon, a mystical apparatus that treated every entrant save the tower's original owner as a dangerous intruder. That is why it had locked Sigo Buntz, the Koviri mage who had purchased the tower at auction, in a cell inside his new property. It tried to do the same with Geralt, but to a determined witcher, a tower full of magic trickery is no obstacle.<br><br>Following Sigo's instructions, Geralt found a tome in the depths of the library entitled "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire." He and the mage used the secrets contained within to disable the tower's defenses. Once free, Sigo, bursting with gratitude, rewarded Geralt (generously, I hope, for the witcher never said exactly how), transported him in a flash to the village where it had all started (well, to be precise, to the bay off the coast from the village), then whisked the tower away for good. Once it was gone, all that remained of the storm were a few puddles and scattered clouds in the otherwise bright and sunny sky. The gathered villagers went wild with joy and showered Geralt with well-deserved thanks.
   1053618|00000000||While traversing the An Skellig coast, Geralt suddenly found himself beset by a fierce storm. A tower stuck awkwardly out of a nearby hill, and, though his medallion tingled as he neared it, Geralt decided to seek shelter there from the driving rain…<br>

   1058746|00000000||The baron’s daughter, Tamara, had disappeared along with her mother some time before Geralt arrived at Crow's Perch. The baron described her as a charming young maid of nineteen summers and the apple of his eye. No wonder, then, that the lord of Crow's Perch was so desperate to find her.<br>
   1058799|00000000||Yet it seemed Tamara had finally had enough of the way the Baron treated her mother and decided to flee along with her.<br>
   1058800|00000000||Geralt found his way to a hut belonging to a fisherman who had helped Tamara and her mother in their flight. There he learned that a horrible beast had captured Anna and dragged her into the swamp. Tamara was able to escape with her life, and had found shelter with a relative of the fisherman in Oxenfurt.<br>
   1058801|00000000||Tamara had indeed made it to Oxenfurt safe and sound and would not even consider returning to her father. Determined to save her mother from the clutches of the creatures that had imprisoned her in the bog, Tamara had joined the ranks of the witch hunters, hoping their support would allow her to survive a trek into Crookback Bog.<br>
   1058802|00000000||Tamara and her escort of witch hunters made it to the swamp clearing, but what she found there was no cause for joy, to say the least. The Crones no longer controlled her mother, true, but the experience had left her with an addled mind.<br><br>Tamara's father, the Bloody Baron, whom hithertofore she had held in contempt, took the high ground this time and swore to travel to the ends of the earth to search out even the slightest hope of returning Anna to a sound mind. Though Tamara did not want to admit it, she appreciated her father's gesture.<br>
   1058803|00000000||Tamara and her escort of witch hunters made it to the swamp clearing and there, to her great astonishment, was her father, who had also set out to free Anna. This family reunion was not, however, to be a moment of celebration - though Anna regained human form and a sound mind for a brief moment, she had only enough strength to bid farewell to her loved ones before passing on.<br>

   1054853|00000000||Every story, even the longest epic, must end, and so this one too now nears its conclusion. Geralt and his friends had acquired the Sunstone and secured the help of Fringilla Vigo. In other words, the long and dangerous process of preparing was over at last and everything was in place for the final battle against the Wild Hunt. All that remained was to summon the Naglfar to the shores of Undvik - and straight into their trap.<br>
   1054854|00000000||Every plan looks best on paper. It was no different this time - though every last detail had been seen to, our heroes were still in for many an unexpected danger and difficult moment. Their division of elite Nilfgaardian soldiers was frozen in ice before it could board the Naglfar. Ciri, who was supposed to stay out of the fighting, was forced into the fray to save Geralt. Meanwhile glory-seeking, fearless (or reckless, some might say) Skelligers rushed into the bay to fight both the riders of the Hunt and the Imperial Fleet at the same time.<br><br>Despite all these complications, in the end the allies defeated the Wild Hunt and Geralt slew its king with his own hands. It was too early to rejoice, however - right before his death Eredin revealed that Avallac'h had betrayed the witcher and had his own nefarious plans for Ciri. Geralt did not know whether to trust his enemy's words - but circumstances did not allow for long and careful deliberation.

   1061675|00000000||Emperor Emhyr had once presented the mages of Nilfgaard with a simple choice: either serve their country unquestioningly or die in prison.<br><br>Fringilla Vigo, a mistress of magic holding office in the vassal duchy of Toussaint, refused both options and instead joined the infamous Lodge of Sorceresses, whose aim was to stand up to the dictates of kings and emperors. These bold ambitions were never fulfilled, however, and Fringilla Vigo lived in fear that her ties to this subversive organization would be discovered and she would meet a quick end at the hands of the emperor's executioners. <br><br><br>One must mention here that Geralt first met Fringilla at the ducal palace in Beauclair many years ago, when we were there enjoying the hospitality of my one-time love, Duchess Anna Henrietta. The witcher, always a sucker for sorceresses, conjoined with Madame Vigo during this time in a quite lively relationship that surely was no cause of joy for Triss or Yennefer.<br>
   1061676|00000000||All indications were that Fringilla had been arrested and remained in a Nilfgaardian prison, undoubtedly awaiting execution for acts of high treason.<br>
   1061677|00000000||She was later released, however, thanks to a bargain Yennefer had struck with Emhyr.<br>

   1059809|00000000||Imlerith - commander of the Wild Hunt and a frequent guest in Geralt's nightmares - had been chasing Ciri for quite some time, striving to deliver her to his ruler, Eredin.<br><br>This powerful and brutal warrior had fought in the countless battles and campaigns for conquest waged by the Aen Elle in other worlds. He prized physical confrontation above all else, seeking out direct, bloody skirmishes where opponents pit their strength, agility and training against each other in a contest to the death.<br>
   1059810|00000000||Imlerith attacked Kaer Morhen along with the rest of the Hunt. There the keep's defenders witnessed heart-wrenching proof of this warrior's dangerous might. Vesemir, who had spent most of his long life with a sword in his hand, heroically stood to fight this foe but, to everyone's great despair, was bested after a bloody and hard-fought confrontation and perished at this monster's hands.<br>
   1059811|00000000||Regardless of race or birth, most warriors share common desires and delights. Imlerith was no exception. Avallac'h informed Ciri that he was wont to wallow in corporeal pleasures and would take advantage of his stay in our world to attend the Crones' sabbath.<br>
   1059820|00000000||Geralt and Ciri thus decided to meet him there and engage him in a final confrontation. Geralt won this battle, killing Imlerith and thus avenging the death of his master, Vesemir.<br>

   1061602|00000000||A wave of religious and racially-motivated killings that swept Novigrad in the spring of 1272 coincided with Hubert Rejk's term as coroner of the city morgue.<br><br>Because of this he was overworked and additionally had to bear the harassment of his dislikeable superior, Reverend Nathaniel. It is thus not surprising that he came across as unpleasant and sarcastic during Geralt's first meeting with him.<br><br>Furthermore, it was clear there was some kind of bad blood between him and Joachim von Gratz, a fact that did little to improve the already rather stiff atmosphere of the morgue. Nevertheless, having learned the reason for Geralt's unexpected visit, Hubert made it clear Geralt and Joachim could count on his help.<br>
   1061603|00000000||It turned out that Hubert had once been Von Gratz's teacher and mentor. Yet when Von Gratz's involvement in the student movement led to bloodshed, Hubert felt he had no choice but to denounce his advisee in order to avoid an escalation of violence.<br>
   1061604|00000000||Hubert proposed to help the witcher perform an autopsy on the serial killer's latest victim, which revealed valuable new clues.<br>
   1061605|00000000||Rejk might have succeeded in shifting the blame to another suspect if not for the witcher's perspicacity. Geralt had already figured out Rejk was the true murderer, but was shocked to learn he was also a powerful vampire.<br><br>Luckily Geralt had considerable experience and a honed skill set to draw on for fighting such a creature. He killed the beast and ended his twisted moral crusade.<br>
   1061606|00000000||When it turned out Rejk had been behind the murders from the very start, Geralt could only curse his short-sightedness and stupidity. It was too late to repair his earlier mistakes. The crazed fanatic escaped justice and left to continue his sick moral crusade elsewhere.<br>

   1060179|00000000||When Geralt encountered a misshapen midget at the Bloody Baron's court, he didn't think much of it. Yet when he heard a similarly deformed being had washed up on Skellige's shores in the same boat in which Ciri and her mysterious companion had sailed off shortly prior, he connected the two at once. It was clear this rough-hewn hunk of flesh was the key to finding Cirilla.<br>
   1060180|00000000||Geralt learned that, prior to arriving at Crow's Perch, Uma had briefly been the possession of Donar, jarl of Hindarsfjall. At some point, however, Donar sold Uma to a merchant from Novigrad, who thought the strange little creature would make a wonderful jester. This must have been the same merchant who then lost Uma to the Bloody Baron in a hand of cards.<br>
   1060182|00000000||We all breathed a sigh of relief to learn that Uma's twisted body and mind were no cruel joke played by nature, but the result of a curse. Now we needed only find a way to lift it…<br>
   1060474|00000000||Geralt didn't know exactly what the deformed being that had sailed to Skellige in Ciri's boat was. He had no doubt, however, that it was somehow tied to her fate - and just might be the key to finding her.<br>
   1060475|00000000||It turned out the diminutive freak had spent some time in the possession of Donar, jarl of Hindarsfjall. Later Donar sold him to a Novigrad merchant who thought he was perfect material for a top-notch jester.<br>
   1060486|00000000||Based on Skjall's detailed description, Geralt was able to recognize the creature at the Baron's castle as the very same deformed midget Skjall saw on Hindarsfjall.<br><br>Sadly, it was impossible to communicate with this "Uma" (as the creature had come to be called). He seemed to dwell in a world all his own.  Yet Geralt knew only Uma held the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1060497|00000000||We all breathed a sigh of relief to learn that Uma's twisted body and mind were no cruel joke played by nature, but the result of a curse. Now we needed only find a way to lift it…<br>
   1060502|00000000||Though Yennefer and Vesemir agreed Uma was suffering from a powerful curse,  they could not reach a consensus about how to go about lifting it. Sharp words were exchanged before Vesemir stepped in and announced that before Yennefer did anything he would try one of the traditional witcher methods.<br><br>All that was left to the others was to wait.<br>
   1060503|00000000||Though Vesemir's method had worked to disenchant the famous Swan of Poviss, it brought no breakthrough here. Vesemir did, however, succeed in confirming that Uma's body was a sort of magic prison in which some other being was trapped.<br><br>Yennefer's method did not prognosticate a high chance for Uma's survival - yet was now the only remaining option for lifting the curse.<br>
   1060507|00000000||The ritual succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. The person cursed inside Uma turned out to be none other than Avallac'h, a powerful elven Sage the witcher had met before.
   1060181|00000000||Sadly, there was no communicating with Uma. The gnarled twiglet lived in his own miniature world. Yet Geralt knew Uma alone was the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's stunted lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1059709|00000000||Uma
   1083237|00000000||As the emperor's spies told it, Ciri had reached Novigrad. No lone attempt to find her in the North's largest city could every make sense. But Geralt had friends he could count on. The witcher decided to contact Triss Merigold.

    384931|00000000||Gimme a bit. Gotta get ready.
    384933|00000000||The pellar shall await you here.
    384925|00000000||No. Gotta get ready first.

    387244|00000000||How's this gonna work?
    387246|00000000||Need anything else?
    387248|00000000||Can I help? Bring any other ingredients?

And they sent me to Velen. If this is what the whole North is like, then I swear on all the gods, I don't have a clue why we're even bothering. Nothing but filth, clap and graves.<br><br>I've been sitting here for two months. Haven't seen a single Redanian yet. Instead of fighting, they got us running errands, each stupider than the last. Now the sergeant's sent us to find some chest. Baubles robbed from the Nordlings, seems. Fell off a wagon as the transport was heading south.<br><br>We've been wandering this swamp for three days now. Only thing we've found was a hole-riddled boot and a cow's skull. What a waste... but if we come back without the chest, they'll send us to the hole and deduct three weeks' wages, so we're going to keep searching. For the glory of the fatherland.<br>
   1077779|00000000||The witcher found the chest. Sadly, nearby he also found the bodies of the guards who were charged with protecting it - they were killed by drowners, like many before them.

   1033267|00000000||Witches burned down the hunters' haunt? Likely story. Hunters set fire to it themselves, to have a reason…

   1083235|00000000||Exhausted and wounded, Ciri collapsed in the swamp. Some peasants then found her and took her to the baron, Velen's self-appointed ruler at the time. The warlord took the young woman in, had her nursed back to full health, then sent her on her way to Novigrad.
   1085123|00000000||The Baron's Hospitality: A Swallow at Crow's Perch
   1086961|00000000||<br>Just when it seemed the villagers would have to learn to live in the shadow of a bloodthirsty beast, to always look to the sky with fear, the witcher arrived - and put an end to the shrieker for good.
   1087335|00000000||<i>Heard you have a problem - a monster you call a shrieker?<br>Aye, prowls about, it does. Snatches cows and goats, mostly, but it won't scorn a man if it runs into one.</i><br>– Conversation overhead at Crow's Perch<br>
   1081316|00000000||The monster tormenting the residents of Crow's Perch turned out to be a particularly nasty cockatrice. Geralt was not surprised the baron's men had been unable to stop it. They could not possibly withstand the surgical precision of its strikes, which slice open arteries and provoke an outpouring of blood only the Swallow potion could hope to stop. Neither did they know to force it to the ground with a crossbow, a bomb or a Sign, and then evade its charge by rolling under the monster's outstretched wing.

    432587|00000000||Ciri's trail took Geralt to Novigrad, the largest city in the North. It would take seas of ink to describe this city accurately, so suffice it to say it is the seat of the Church of the Eternal Fire, a bustling port city and a haven for artists… as well as all sorts of other shady characters.<br><br>Yet Novigrad at this time was not the city Geralt knew from his earlier travels. War raged throughout the known world, and rich cities are always tempting morsels to armies on the march. It was clear by then that this particular morsel had both Radovid and Emhyr greedily licking their chops. Within the city, the Temple Guard acted with impunity under the command of a cankerous snot named Caleb Menge and with the support of that terror-spreading band of zealots, the witch hunters. Meanwhile, the bosses of the city's underworld still held much of it in their sleazy grasp.<br><br>Finding Ciri here would be like searching for a needle in a burning haystack - Geralt would clearly need some assistance. Luckily, an old acquaintance of his now lived in Novigrad, and her name was Triss Merigold.<br>
    432588|00000000||Ever since Radovid had given the witch hunters a free hand, the persecution of mages had ascended to new heights everywhere in the North - and Novigrad was no exception. The smell of burning flesh filled the air as the witch hunters set fire to freaks and mages of all kinds during gruesome public spectacles. Triss had been forced into hiding, and Geralt was forced to go to great lengths to find her. When he finally did, she was glad to see a friendly face, even one that brought back some still-painful memories.<br><br>Triss had no knowledge where Ciri might have gone, but she did know an individual who could be of help - a dreamer named Corinne Tilly.

   1077604|00000000||<i>Cremation, now that's one thing men could learn from gnomes. Burying bodies out in the fields, why, it's like laying out a welcome mat for monsters! Best case scenario, some ghouls will sniff them out, eat their fill and be on their ghoulish way. But if, gods forbid, a grave hag takes to feeding at your cemetery, you'll have no end of trouble." <br>– </i>Jacques de Villepin, Oxenfurt Academy<br><br>Few monsters' names fit as well as the grave hags'. As one might guess, these creatures resemble aged, deformed women and loiter near graveyards and battlefields. Grave hags feed on human corpses and in particular on the rotten marrow which they slurp from human bones using their long, prehensile tongues. Once a hag has devoured all corpses within reach, she turns to killing men and burying them in the cemetery as she waits for them to decompose.<br>
   1077605|00000000||Grave hags use their tongues in combat to grab or flog their victims. Claws built for digging up buried bodies serve just as well as weapons to rend flesh. Though clumsy in appearance, grave hags move and attack at great speed – sometimes even a witcher's reflexes are too slow to avoid their blows.<br><br>Grave hags are territorial creatures. Their lairs resemble caricatures of human homes and are built near burial sites. They venture out at night to hunt, stalking straggling travelers or mourners too lost in their grief to notice the setting of the sun. On rare occasions hunger-driven grave hags will hunt during the day. They are less dangerous at such times, for sunlight weakens them considerably.

   1083233|00000000||While searching for the witch Ciri had quarelled with, Geralt ran into an old friend - Keira Metz. The sorceress told the witcher about a masked mage with a hideout, where Ciri was supposed to have hidden. The witcher set off for the hideout with Keira in tow.
   1083234|00000000||Ciri had, in fact, never reached the elven mage – yet the Wild Hunt had. The ghostly retinue was one step ahead of Geralt - or so it seemed. Geralt felt that all was lost, until Keira gave him a new lead - the Crones of Crookback Bog.

   1051952|00000000||While traversing the woods outside Novigrad, Geralt came across some monster tracks that struck him as unusual. He decided it was worth his time to see what sort of beast was prowling around this close to the North's great metropolis.<br>
   1051953|00000000||A certain halfling named Brean Hotsch had hung a notice stating he was in need of a professional monster slayer. Geralt decided to see what was the matter.<br>
   1051954|00000000||After a detailed investigation of the shrubbery and thicketry lining the forest floor (what exactly he looks for during such investigations is a complete mystery to me - I see nothing but endless chances to tear one's hose), Geralt concluded he was tracking a leshen.

   1059791|00000000||Baroness Maria Louisa la Valette was the talk of Temeria in her time. This noblewoman had been King Foltest's mistress and even bore him two illegitimate children.<br><br>This caused quite the scandal and prompted several notable families to take up arms in revolt, only to be bloodily crushed by the king's forces, who took La Valette Castle during a hard-fought siege.<br>
   1059792|00000000||Sadly, this siege led to the death of the baroness' eldest son. Sword in hand he had fought to defend his mother's honor but fell to Geralt of Rivia, who was with King Foltest at the time.<br><br>No one could blame Louisa la Valette for harboring a deep-seated hatred for the witcher, a hatred which became quite apparent the next time they crossed paths.<br>
   1059795|00000000||To the baroness' good fortune Geralt of Rivia was with King Foltest at the time and saved her son Aryan from the fate that otherwise would have been his for having participated in the revolt.<br><br>Louisa la Valette thus had every reason to think quite highly of the witcher and her esteem became quite apparent the next time they crossed paths.

These ravings subsided after an administration of henbane and poppy extract." </i><br>– Joachim von Gratz's notes, Vilmerius Hospital in Novigrad<br><br>When plague ravages a region, a spirit will sometimes walk its lands, a ghost resembling an ill woman whose flesh rots off her bones and in whose wake crawls a cavalcade of rats. No one knows whether this spirit brings the pox with her or is merely drawn to it like a moth to a light. Yet it is certain that she delights in dealing pain and suffering, in hearing the howling and moaning of men.<br>
   1077289|00000000||Many have called into question the very existence of plague maidens, or pestae, as they are sometimes called. Only two sightings of such a creature have ever been recorded, both during times of raging epidemic.<br><br>As the name "plague maiden" suggests, these wraiths take the appearance of females, though exactly why that is remains a mystery. Some speculate they, like other such specters, arise from the powerful emotional charge associated with certain circumstances of death, such as death preceded by a long and particularly painful illness.<br><br>Not much is known about how to fight a plague maiden, though one can assume they possess many traits in common with other phantoms and wraiths. They undoubtedly pose a great danger, though a witcher's immunities should at least prevent him from catching the contagious illnesses they carry.

   1060736|00000000||Skellige sagas brim with praise for war chiefs and warrior-braves of ages past, yet the saga of Crach, jarl of Clan an Craite and lord of Kaer Trolde, will outshine them all. It will sing of his strength, his courage, his wisdom, his generosity, his loyalty to friends and his relentless pursuit of his foes.<br><br>There will be few exaggerations in such a tale, for Crach, the mightiest of Skellige's jarls, truly did possess all the traits of a hero. He aroused terror in his enemies - in fact, Nilfgaardian mothers would use his name to frighten their children into obedience, and all in that empire spoke in hushed tones of the infamous Tirth ys Muire, the Wild Boar of the Sea, who devastated coastal provinces during frequent and terrible raids.<br><br>Geralt had known Crach for long, since a time when as a young man the jarl had sought the hand of young Pavetta, Ciri's mother.<br>
   1060737|00000000||After Bran's demise, Crach could easily have claimed the throne for himself. Yet he preferred to support the claim of his son, Hjalmar. When his daughter Cerys announced her intention to seek the throne as well, the jarl also gave her his support, showing no favoritism when it came to his children.<br>
   1060743|00000000||To the islanders, honor is the most prized of virtues. Crach thus agreed without hesitation to live up to the pledge he made many years ago on behalf of himself and his entire clan and supported the search for Cirilla with any means Skellige could offer.<br>
   1060744|00000000||Crach also did not balk when the time came to stand and fight Eredin. Though Eredin killed Crach during this fight, the jarl's death did not break the islanders' spirit, instead becoming a model of how to die like a true hero.<br>

   1083232|00000000||Yet Geralt reached Hendrik too late - the Wild Hunt had gotten to him first. He found only the spy's corpse, though the wraith riders had failed to find his notes.

   1050584|00000000||Of all the so-called "witches" they hunted, there was none the witch hunters wanted more than Triss Merigold, a sorceress of unequaled power. Even in hiding she had proven a thorn in their side, masterminding an underground net of hideouts and covers, keeping other mages out of the hunters' blood-stained hands. When Geralt entered the city, he met up with his dear friend and sometime love. And when the time came that she needed his help with her endeavor, she did not hesitate to ask.<br>
   1050585|00000000||Their contact revealed that the son of Ingrid Vegelbud, scion of a wealthy Novigrad family, dabbled in alchemy. For that reason he had become a person of much interest to the witch hunters. When Ingrid learned of Triss' operations, she sent her servant to ask the sorceress to spirit her son somewhere far away from his persecutors. The hunters kept a close eye on her residence, so they would need a distraction - and her upcoming masquerade ball promised to provide just that.<br>
   1050776|00000000||Young Albert's rescue did not prove to be Triss' slickest extraction ever. First she had trouble even finding the young alchemist amidst the throng of revelers, and then Geralt ran into trouble with a group of witch hunter infiltrators. Still, with a bit of luck and a bit of cunning our heroes managed to escape the residence and smuggle Vegelbud out without a scratch on him. Mission accomplished. Geralt and Triss had proven once again how well they work together as a team - but as a couple, well, events at the Vegelbuds' only complicated that matter...<br>
   1054588|00000000||Geralt and Triss attended the masquerade ball at the Vegelbuds' residence. Their mission: rescue young Albert. Geralt, however, must have downed one cocktail too many and wandered off before they could fulfill it. Albert was arrested. Triss was furious with Geralt - and much water flowed under Saint Gregory's Bridge before she forgave him.<br>
   1086762|00000000||She had received a very tempting proposition and needed Geralt to accompany her to the Novigrad fish market. A fish market, you say? Had the hunters taken to persecuting flounder as well? Was a mage in desperate need of some herring? I will ignore the sarcasm in your tone and tell you this: the mysterious man awaiting them there would provide answers to all these questions - and more.<br>
   1087089|00000000||At first everything went smoothly and Triss truly believed that, with the witcher's help, she would successfully sneak Albert Vegelbud out of the city, thus saving his life. Yet there was one thing she did not foresee: that Geralt would prove the weak link in her plan and fail to show up at the ball. No one likes being stood up, least of all a sorceress. Thus a lot of water flowed under St. Gregory's Bridge before she let go of her anger...
   1054587|00000000||Their contact did indeed await them at the fish market but - prepare yourselves - at the last minute Geralt changed his mind and ran off on some other errand. Geralt's fickle-heartedness led to tragedy - unknown evildoers killed the informant. Triss had no way to follow up on her proposition, and so was understandably furious with the witcher.<br>

   1053214|00000000||On one of Skellige's beaches, Geralt ran into a man desperately fending off an enraged assailant. The witcher could hardly look upon this spectacle impassively and decided to help. After the fight, Ivar, for this was the man's name, admitted his attacker had been the brother of the woman Ivar loved. He had sought to kill Ivar for seducing his sister, who was a priestess of Freya and thus bound by custom to a live a life of chastity. Ivar, however, refused to let religion stand in the way of his love and aimed to scour learned books for a precedent that would help him negotiate his beloved's release from her vows. Geralt agreed to bring him any relevant books he found.<br>

   1072914|00000000||Sadly, help came too late and the fierce warrior paid for her hot-headedness with her life.<br>
   1072915|00000000||Ves' rash move landed her in a horrible pot of trouble that only Geralt's sword could dish her out of.<br>
   1072916|00000000||Even had Ves not owed Geralt her life, she would have come to the defense of Kaer Morhen all the same, for she would follow Vernon Roche into the very bowels of the abyss.<br>
   1072917|00000000||Ves had been a soldier all her life, a fact which made her unfortunate death during a political intrigue even bitterer. At least one part of her death matched her life: she fell at her commander's side.

   1061146|00000000||Though the youngest of the three Crones, Weavess was not one jot less ugly or evil than her older sisters. It was she who wove their magical tapestries from human hair, gathered as tribute from the young children of nearby villagers during their "cutting" ceremonies. These tapestries were how the Ladies of the Wood's worshipers made contact with and paid homage to their deities.<br>
   1061147|00000000||The fight on Bald Mountain was meant to put an end to all three Crones, but Weavess evaded her elder sisters' fate. She was able to escape by transforming into a flock of ravens and took Cirilla's medallion with her.

   1048592|00000000||Cities like Novigrad have their own, special magic. They attract folk from all corners of the world, becoming delicious stews of diverse flavors, giant circuses filled with colorful characters just waiting to extend a helping hand - or swing a sharp elbow. Ciri had experienced the fullness of this during her stay in Novigrad, so when she found herself back in the city she decided to repay a few debts - and settle a few scores...<br>
   1048595|00000000||First name on her list - Whoreson Junior. Though Geralt swore he had killed Whoreson with his own hands, rumor had it the mafioso was alive and well. Geralt and Ciri thus decided to pay him a surprise visit. They discovered Dudu had turned Whoreson's death into a prime business opportunity. He took on the underworld boss' form, and then took over his criminal organization, transforming it into a legal, and more profitable than ever, enterprise.<br>
   1050966|00000000||Geralt decided to accompany Ciri on her sentimental journey. First name on her list - Whoreson Junior. They finally found him wallowing in the gutter in the Bits. One look at his pathetic state and Ciri lost all desire for vengeance. Whoreson was a husk of a man, alone, disgraced and embittered, in no way resembling the old Whoreson Junior, member of the Big Four and terror of Novigrad. Ciri decided she could think of no worse fate for him and left him to it.<br>
   1050994|00000000||The next debt Ciri had to repay was with a young woman named Bea. She took an immediate liking to our friend the witcher, and he in turn was not left indifferent by her considerable charms. Ah, had they but world enough and time… But they hadn't, so Ciri and Geralt moved on to an itinerant circus troupe's camp outside Novigrad. <br><br>It was here that Valdo and his comrades had taken Ciri in when she had no place to stay and not a copper to her name. She was welcomed no less warmly upon her return. Valdo proposed she and Geralt stay for some friendly horseracing and a pleasant evening of drink and dance around the fire. Geralt knew they both could use a moment to catch their breath and accepted the invitation.<br>
   1050995|00000000||Our friends were eating, drinking and delighting in the joyful atmosphere of the circus performers' camp when a certain Aegar came to them and asked for help. He needed to steal some horses from a Novigrad merchant. Geralt did not think this was the sort of thing Ciri and he should be getting involved with, but Aegar wouldn't relent. One thing led to another and soon this petty disagreement had turned into an all-out brawl. Afterwards no one, Ciri least of all, was in a festive mood. She went for a riverside walk to cool her head, the circus performers returned to their tents and the witcher... well, the witcher took care of some witcher business.<br>
   1051007|00000000||Our friends were eating, drinking and delighting in the joyful atmosphere of the circus performers' camp when a certain Aegar came to them and asked for help. He needed to steal some horses from a Novigrad merchant. Geralt let Ciri convince him to participate in this heist. And he didn't regret it. What a rollicking adventure they had! First the tense thrills of sneaking into the stables, then the mad joy of galloping off, the wind in their hair. A spark of happiness flashed in Ciri's eyes, the first in a long, long while. This was the best reward the witcher had ever received.<br>

   1051839|00000000||Craven's reanimated corpse told Geralt and Yennefer about Ciri's stay on Hindarsfjall. She had made a dramatic entrance, popping out of thin air in a narrow escape from some unknown danger. Exhausted and wounded, she was carried by a mysterious companion who then entrusted her into Craven's care. He took her home, where his family tended to her with warmth and kindness. For the first time in a very long while, Ciri had a moment to catch her breath and enjoy life's simple comforts.<br>
   1051858|00000000||Sadly, she was not given long to savor these blissful moments. The Wild Hunt had caught Ciri's scent. Dark clouds gathered in the sky, puddles began to ice over and the ruthless wraiths rode towards the village. Ciri knew she was in no shape to defeat her assailants. Craven, or rather Skjall, for that was the unfortunate lad's true name, decided to help her, putting his own life and honor at risk.<br><br>Ciri raced off to Drowned Dead Rock, where she rejoined her masked companion. From what Skjall could see the two got into some sort of quarrel, which the mysterious man ended by putting Ciri to sleep with a spell. He then set her down in a boat and sailed off with her into the thick fog blanketing the surrounding sea. <br><br> Ciri had thus escaped the Wild Hunt once again. Skjall was less fortunate - the wraiths had wounded him and left him for dead. Yet he had life in him still and fought his way back to consciousness. When his eyes opened, he saw he was lying on the beach near a boat - the very same vessel in which Ciri and her companion had sailed away the night before. Now it bore but a single, highly unusual passenger -- the ugliest man in the world.

   1061637|00000000||A dwarf, a soldier of fortune, a veteran of the Battle of Brenna, an unassailable optimist, a committed altruist, a lover of rough drinks and rougher songs, a master gwent player and, above all, a dear and loyal friend to me and Geralt - ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Zoltan Chivay. We first became fast friends years ago, when Geralt and I ran into Zoltan and the band he was leading at the time across war-stricken Riverdell.<br><br>It proved our fate to cross paths many times after, and we eventually became inseparable companions, sticking together through good and ill. At our tale's beginning Zoltan and I had gone into business together running a Novigrad tavern called the Rosemary and Thyme.<br>
   1061638|00000000||By saving me from the transport taking me to my doom Zoltan proved yet again he would never abandon a friend in need. In return, Zoltan soon found himself on the receiving end of an act of friendship. Suffering some financial difficulties, he had taken out a loan from one of the Novigrad mob bosses, and as a result had made many unfortunate enemies.<br><br>He planned to repay his debt by gathering a prize collection of gwent cards - a risky endeavor, given the cutthroat nature of Novigrad gwent circles at the time, and one that would have never worked without Geralt's help.<br>
   1061639|00000000||In another adventure that took place during this time, Geralt asked Zoltan to distract the guards at Deireadh prison. The planned ruse proved impossible to pull off, however, and so the dwarf resorted to more reliable, direct methods. His quick thinking considerably eased the witcher's getaway.<br>
   1072872|00000000||Zoltan naturally would never have sat out the defense of Kaer Morhen. In fact, I don't think he'd ever have forgiven Geralt if he'd been left out of the chance to smash some evil heads in good company.

   1055884|00000000||Malicious beings usually haunt the ruins of castles, fortresses or, as a last resort, towers. The wraith of White Orchard, however, chose a much more quotidian site for its haunting: a well. A White Orchard peasant by the name of Odolan wanted someone to chase off the phantom and Geralt accepted the job.<br>
   1055886|00000000||Though Geralt had rid the village of the noonwraith, he could not stop thinking about the unfortunate woman the phantom had once been. Who was responsible for her untimely death? What had she done to bring this upon herself? Just who was she? Thanks to the dedication inscribed on the bracelet he found in the cave, Geralt was able to get answers to these questions from White Orchard's herbalist. She recounted to him the story of the area's troubled past.<br>
   1055885|00000000||It turned out the devil haunting the well was a noonwraith: the ghost of a young woman who had died a sudden and cruel death. The witcher found her body hanging from the well's bucket rope and, nearby, a bracelet that must have belonged to her while she lived. Destroying this object broke the tie binding the poor woman's ghost to this world and allowed Geralt to chase it off once and for all.<br>
   1084262|00000000||In White Orchard Geralt happened across a notice posted by a certain Odolan residing in the village. The man wanted someone to take out the monster who was haunting the area around an old well - and doing so required a professional. This was as typical of witcher work as they come, so Geralt decided to talk to the man.<br>
   1062767|00000000||Sadly, the girl who was gripped by fever died before Geralt could get rid of the ghost keeping her from receiving the well's clean waters. All Geralt could do then was convey his condolences.<br>
   1058444|00000000||Malicious beings usually haunt the ruins of castles, fortresses or, as a last resort, towers. The wraith of White Orchard, however, chose a much more everyday site for her haunting: a well. Geralt decided to drive this being off - perhaps to prevent it from harming anyone dwelling nearby, or perhaps in hope that someone would pay him for his trouble.<br>
   1058474|00000000||Geralt found the body of the woman who had turned into the noonwraith hanging from the well's bucket rope and, nearby, a bracelet that had once belonged to her. Destroying this object broke the tie binding the poor woman's ghost to this world and allowed Geralt to chase it off once and for all. After he did this, he was pleased to learn there was a contract out for the monster's eradication, a bounty he collected with a sense of having performed his duties well.<br>

   1053026|00000000||At one point during his travels Geralt learned of a master alchemist named Gremist. Rumor had it this druid knew more about alchemy than most men know about the contours of their own members. Geralt, ever eager to polish his skills, decided to find this learned druid and absorb whatever knowledge from him he could.<br>
   1053027|00000000||This Gremist proved to be a strange individual, but then so do most mages and druids - routinely staring into the abyss of otherworldly power has that effect. Rather than let Geralt learn from him right away, he first forced him to undergo three trials. Geralt passed all three with flying colors and the druid had no choice but to take him on as an apprentice. Thus Geralt, showing an admirable commitment to lifelong learning, gathered his chalk and prepared his slate for some advanced alchemy lessons.

   1077913|00000000||<i>Again?! Good grief, woman, I'm spent…</i><br>– Lester of Smallton to a succubus, a few days before taking a vow of celibacy<br><br>Unlike other monsters, succubi and menads feel no desire to kill, do not crave human blood and usually do not, in fact, mean any harm at all. They are motivated by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable lust. They try in vain to slake this by engaging in sexual acts with any other humanoid species they encounter. While it must be admitted that their "victims" rarely put up much resistance, this does not mean succubi and menads do not present any danger: their never-ending advances, though pleasurable at first, have pushed more than one man to madness or even death.<br>
   1077914|00000000||Succubi and menads usually can be found near human settlements, including small villages and populous cities. They prowl at night, though when stricken by serious need they will leave their lairs during the day as well. They shower their affections on men as well as women, the young as well as the old, the ugly as well as the beautiful. Some of them are particularly fond of pastors and other holy men, whose seduction they treat as a sort of game.<br><br>Though succubi are peaceful by nature, when forced to fight they will defend themselves fiercely. One should thus not be fooled by their fair appearance – under the velvety skin of their arms lie muscles of iron, and a blow delivered with their rear, goat-like legs or the thick horns on their head can easily crush bone.

Second – so you don't attract drowners.</i><br>– Yanneck of Blaviken, fisherman<br><br>A drowner resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it. That is why it is often thought drowners - along with their more dangerous cousins: vodniks, mucknixers and drowned dead – arise from the bodies of those who drown in shallow water: lost travelers falling into bogs, children who swim too far from the shore or, in the case of vodniks, inebriated peasants who stumble off narrow swamp trails.<br>
   1077571|00000000||Like so many other beliefs about monsters, this one is false. While drowners do look like humans from a distance, witchers, who have the dubious pleasure of examining them from close quarters, have reported the numerous ways in which their anatomy differs from our own. Their scaly skin, gills and dorsal fins suggest drowners and their like are an entirely foreign species.<br><br>The adaptations mentioned above make drowners excellent swimmers, well-suited to the muddy waters of the ponds and lakes in which they dwell. They often cluster near human settlements, which are for them an excellent source of food.<br><br>Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. They can attack with lightning speed, taking their victim by surprise and pulling him into the water to drown. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling – at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland.<br><br>Drowners, mucknixers, vodniks and drowned dead all live in putrid, rotting filth, and so have developed a high resistance to poison. Though humanoid in form, they are primitive creatures no more intelligent than carp or pike. That is why spells affecting the mind, the Axii Sign included, are ineffective against them. Yet they are particularly vulnerable to magic drawn from the element of fire, including the Igni Sign.

   1050664|00000000||At last, the day had come. The long interregnum was at an end. The jarls of Skellige had gathered to choose which of the claimants would be crowned King Bran's successor. Notable representatives from the clans and common Skelligers alike rubbed shoulders around the sacred oak on Hindarsfjall, eager to witness the coronation of their new ruler. Among them - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1050665|00000000||It was done. The Skelligers had spoken. Hjalmar an Craite was the Isles' new ruler. Many grumbled that this heralded a time of storms and imminent war with Nilfgaard. Others cheered, content in the thought that their young leader was backed by a sage and experienced advisor, his father - the cool pond of his wisdom to temper Hjalmar's red-hot steel. All agreed their new king was a warrior, strong and fearless, who would give not an inch to any invader.
   1050666|00000000||It was done. The Skelligers had spoken, choosing Cerys an Craite to be their new queen. Though in the past other women had sat on Skellige's throne, many islanders worried the turbulent times would simply overwhelm young Cerys. Others rejoiced at the outcome, believing Cerys' accession guaranteed that peace would one day reign in Skellige. Who was in the right? Time would soon tell…

   1056104|00000000||Ciri's trail had led Geralt and Yennefer to a derelict garden in Skellige. There they hoped to find the man called Craven, who alone could provide answers to their burning questions. Unfortunately, they were first greeted by an entirely different individual - a monster known as Morkvarg. It seemed Geralt once more would have to stain his silver sword with blood.<br>
   1056105|00000000||Freya's garden - once the pride of Hindarsfjall, nay, of all the Isles - had fallen into ruin. This had happened on account of a certain Morkvarg, a cruel pirate for whom nothing was sacred. The punishment for his deeds was a curse that transformed him into a monster and imprisoned him inside the garden walls. There he roamed for years until Freya's priestesses decided it was time to get rid of him for good. They promised a generous reward to any brave man who could drive him off - or, better yet, kill him.<br>
   1056106|00000000||The Skellige Isles have a long and rich history. Scattered throughout their rocky lands are many mysterious ruins, elven relics, ancient woods and natural marvels. One of the places that most stuck in Geralt's memory was the abandoned garden near Freya's temple. Geralt discovered it by accident, and found there was work waiting for him within - a powerful monster prowled inside its crumbling walls.<br>
   1056112|00000000||Geralt decided to try an innovative curse-lifting method - feeding the werewolf his own flesh. Geralt's efforts were a partial success. The curse was lifted, but Morkvarg died without ever reassuming his human form. Considering the hideous deeds this cruel pirate had wrought, one's heart does not exactly burst with pity for him.
   1056113|00000000||Geralt tracked down one of Morkvarg's former companions who lived in Larvik. His jaw dropped to learn this man - and not, as was commonly thought, Freya's high priestess - had cast the curse on the infamous pirate. The man also possessed an object he claimed could lift the curse. Geralt took it from him, and used it to return Morkvarg to human form - thus rendering him mortal. Geralt then struck an expert blow to hasten the inevitable end this condition implied. Clearly he felt that years of insatiable hunger were not punishment enough for this man's many sins.
   1056114|00000000||Geralt tracked down one of Morkvarg's former companions who lived in Larvik. His jaw dropped to learn this man - and not, as was commonly thought, Freya's high priestess - had cast the curse on the infamous pirate. The man also possessed an object he claimed could lift the curse. Geralt took it from him, used it to return Morkvarg to human form - and then let him go free. This might strike you as strange, dear reader, considering this former pirate's many sins and complete unwillingness to reform. Remember, however, that it is a witcher's job to kill monsters, not people, no matter how rotten they might be.
   1056111|00000000||Geralt learned the curse hadn't just turned Morkvarg into a monster - it had sentenced him to eternal hunger as well. He knew from decades of experience that such curses can be lifted by feeding the monster of one's own and unforced volition. In this case, however, the tried and true method did not work - the food scattered into ash as soon as Morkvarg brought it near his lips.<br>

   1061641|00000000||All witchers have a great deal in common, but with Eskel and Geralt, the similarities are particularly striking. They first met as two boys of the same age swinging wooden swords at Kaer Morhen. They then went through an ordeal together: the first round of selections, the murderous Changes, the Trial of the Grasses, and training on the Gauntlet - the witchers’ daunting obstacle course. They also received hidings together for more than one act of childish delinquency. When they became adults, they walked the Path separately, but still reconvened at Kaer Morhen nearly every winter to wait out the cold, drink to their successes and commemorate fallen comrades.<br><br>Though Eskel never gained Geralt’s renown, he equaled the White Wolf in terms of experience and carried out his contracts with care and efficiency. Death had lamost taken him many times during his hunts, yet in an ironic twist the hideous scar on his face came not from a monster’s claw but from the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his highly unpredictable Unexpected Child.<br>
   1061642|00000000||Perhaps this traumatic experience lay at the root of Eskel's dislike for Yennefer, though he tried not to let this get in the way of his friendship with Geralt.<br>
   1061643|00000000||Eskel took active part in the defense of Kaer Morhen, standing bravely in the face of overwhelming odds to fight one of the Hunt's generals. When Vesemir died, he took over responsibility for watching over the witchers' keep.

They are instead post-Conjunction monsters who have no particular feelings about garlic, holy water or religious symbols.<br><br>Unlike their portrayals in ballads and legends, they look nothing like handsome, pale aristocrats with charming eastern accents, though, like katakans or nekurats, they do bear a strong resemblance to overgrown bats.

There she would assume her rightful place as heir to the throne - next in line to be empress of the most powerful state in the world.

   1051222|00000000||While wandering Velen Geralt happened across a woman who was weeping violently. She explained that her betrothed had gone into the woods to check his traps but never returned - and she feared the worst. Geralt calmed her and promised to check what had become of her beloved.<br>
   1051223|00000000||When Geralt returned from the woods, he did not bring good news with him. The woman saw this in his face at once. Though her hands trembled and her eyes welled with bitter tears, she did not forget to pay the witcher what he was owed and thank him with some kind words.

    478627|00000000||Geralt met a man who claimed one of his horses had been stolen by some kind of woodland spook. The witcher promised to bring back the missing mare.<br>
   1051215|00000000||Geralt ventured deep into the woods in his search for the stolen horse. There he came across a Scoia'tael camp. These elves, and not a spook, had stolen the missing horse. The witcher was determined to recover the villager's lost property, but the Scoia'tael were equally determined to keep their takings. Luckily, Geralt managed to strike a deal with them and no blood was shed over the matter.<br>

   1078435|00000000||It is an innkeeper's job to tend to his guests' needs. Usually this takes the form of serving strong drinks and listening to tales of loves lost and wounds received. Yet at times a patron will wish to play a hand of gwent, which is why all good innkeepers keep a deck at the ready at all times. And the excellent ones - they keep excellent decks, full of top-notch cards that can provide an evening of challenge and excitement to even the most refined gwent player. Geralt was determined to win some of these cards for himself.<br>

   1077281|00000000||<i>Some men have got good reason to fear their own shadows.</i><br>– Svargmitt, An Skellig druid<br><br>Monsters most commonly claim innocents as their victims: tardy merchants, reckless children and travelers who wander into dark woodlands out of misplaced curiosity. None of the above need fear hyms, however. These wraiths only latch onto particularly despicable individuals who have committed some unspeakable crime. To all others, they remain completely invisible. When they do show themselves to the one they torment, they appear as a tall, shadow-clad, humanoid silhouette with long, sharp claws.<br>
   1077282|00000000||Yet hyms do not sink these claws into their victims. Instead, they sap their strength indirectly, through inflicting suffering. Speaking in a voice only the victim hears, they drive him to commit acts of violence, aggression and self-harm. A hym will seize on a guilty person's worst fears and weave out of them hideous visions, slowing driving the poor soul into madness. <br><br>Those tormented by a hym are incapable of restful sleep, for they are tormented by ever-more-frequent, incredibly-realistic nightmares. At times the victim will become extremely on edge, yelling pleas or threats at invisible phantoms or confessing his guilt out loud in the hope this will end his torment. This act does not, however, bring any relief, for the hym will not leave until it has addled its victim's wits completely or driven him to suicide.

   1049825|00000000||The search for Ciri had taken Yennefer to the wind-swept Skellige Isles - that is to say, lest your mind fill with visions of our elegant sorceress shivering on some barren rock - it had taken her to a suite of comfortable rooms near Kaer Trolde Castle on the isle of Ard Skellig. Geralt was to join her there and thus set off to the port in Novigrad, where he hoped to find a captain bold enough to brave the pirate-infested waters en route.<br>
   1049826|00000000||After much searching, Geralt found just such a man. A certain Captain Wolverstone had agreed to sail to Skellige. Whether he was abnormally brave or abnormally stupid is unknown - the vodka he gulped in buckets could have enhanced either quality. We can also hope it helped sooth his nerves when, to no one's surprise, pirates attacked the ship off the archipelago's shores. Geralt was thrown overboard during the tussle, and awoke face-down in the Skellige sand.
   1049829|00000000||Geralt recovered from his tumultuous landing and eventually reached Kaer Trolde castle - home to Crach, jarl of Clan an Craite. There he discovered all the notables of Skellige had gathered to bury King Bran, who had breathed his last a few days prior. In attendance as well: Yennefer.

   1079676|017a0e31||A Veil hangs between the world men see and the one they cannot. This Veil blocks the dead from the view of the living, and the living from the view of the dead. Some mages can break through this Veil and communicate with the dead, or else summon them to the World of the Sun for short periods of time. This is the art known as necromancy.<br><br>The dead can also break through the Veil and enter the world of the living on their own. Yet unlike the necromancers, in doing so they are not driven by reason and will, but by a thoughtless, irrational need. This need arises from powerful emotions such as regret, longing or wrath. Very often these emotions gain their power by being invested in a material object by the dead individual while he or she still knew life. The objects most frequently so endowed? Wedding rings, favorite toys - or the instrument used for the crime which sent the returned individual to the other world in the first place.

   1075862|02685eb4||Alexander Hoe walked down the long corridor, delighted that the sounds of debauchery pouring out of the rooms drowned out the sound of his footsteps. The long-neglected brothel floor creaked and moaned, as though the wood regretted being witness to the lecherous scenes fed to it by this house of ill-repute standing in the very center of the pride of the Northern cities. Hoe had been generously remunerated for this visit by the wife of a silk merchant. She had long suspected her husband of dabbling with loose women during his working hours. The case had seemed simple enough, banal, even. A cheating husband. How many similar affairs had he unraveled?<br><br>The worst was that his employers never truly wanted him to bring irrefutable proof of their husbands' guilt. On the contrary, in their heart of hearts they always hoped his investigations would prove their husbands model citizens, and their suspicions wholly unfounded. This time, it truly did turn out that the woman's husband was no whoremonger, despite the fact that his trail led Alexander to a place in which fleshly pleasures were bought and sold.<br><br>The door in front of which he stopped, following the instructions he had received from the gnome at the entrance, had a small plaque with the number sixteen on it. Unlike the other rooms, this one was enveloped in an unsettling calm. Hoe turned the door knob and pushed the door open - and what he saw behind it far exceeded his worst expectations…

   1080347|032ee6d0||Of the many demons which reside in the outer spheres, hyms are among the most dangerous. Other demons usually must take on concrete living form - be it of man or beast. Hyms, on the other hand, appear in our world in their own immaterial form, which is invisible to all save their chosen victim.<br><br>Hyms feed on fear, regret, a sense of guilt - in a word, on negative emotions, and since they are eternally hungry, they provoke these emotions in the humans they torment. These demons cannot be exorcized. A man a hym takes as a victim is lost and will inevitably succumb to madness, and then death.

    469954|06b28b45||Among the numerous faiths of the Nordlings, the most widespread is the cult of Melitele, a goddess in three forms: young girl, mature woman and old hag. Melitele is a Mother Goddess, caring for her children. Primarily women pray to her, though men in need might also utter supplications. The religion is a vestige of the old matriarchy and testifies to the weakness of the Nordlings - people who worship female deities are soft-hearted and incapable of preparing their sons for war.<br><br>In recent years, the cult of Melitele has found a rival in the cult of the Eternal Fire, which came out of Novigrad. Clerics of the Eternal Fire demonstrate fanaticism and almost complete devotion. The religion is hostile toward any form of otherness, including non-humans. The Order of the Flaming Rose is the cult's military arm.<br><br><br><br>The treatise also examines other faiths, including the cult of the Lionhead Spider.

This is the only way to heal our isles.<br>If Skellige is to survive, it has to change. And for that we need a strong leader and an end to the eternal quarreling between the jarls. The only way that will happen is if someone shakes our countrymen, and hard, so that they wake from their slumber of foolish and destructive traditions. The feast at Kaer Trolde is our chance to deliver this shake.<br>Convince the Vildkaarls to ride to an Craite's castle, but don't tell them what fate has in store for them. No doubt many of their number would see the justice of our cause and willingly give their lives for Skellige – but the fewer who know about our plan, the better. We can't risk someone warning Crach. Let them be unwitting tools with which we will forge a better future for out isle.<br>Do as I ask, and my gratitude will know no limits. You will sit by my throne as my advisor. I will expel Ermion from the Druids' Circle and make you hierophant. I will drive off Freya's priestesses and make you lord of their temple and land.<br>I'm counting on you.

I thought we were done for, that we'd die in those swamps - and here we've run into a camp. I walked up real careful-like - folk've chased us outta more than one village already - but this one was empty as can be! Tents, barrels, but not a trace of people. So Macros and I decided we'd stay here, for a while, at least, wait till the war ends. Perhaps Velen's not as bad as they say?<br><br>Your Borias

   1079378|0b4fc9ac||Himmy,<br><br>No wonder we're losing this war, with cowardly cunts for soldiers! All it took were a few arrows and a wallop of the mace for seasoning, and that was that - battle was over and the whole convoy was ours for the picking. Maybe they were having such a hard time of it because of all that vodka they were carrying. Our brave warriors must've taken a sip from time to time, with obvious results - when you're seeing double, it's damned hard to hit your target.<br><br>Take everything we gathered to the cubby, then fence it quick as you can. Except that showy parade shite - you'll have to bury or burn that. I reckon someone might recognize the insignia and then there'd be trouble.<br><br>-Caius

    498540|0c64b4a8||The 3rd of Feainn<br><br>Hot summer days have come earlier than usual this year. Humbert has grown unbearable. He gets angry whenever I accompany the milkmaids to the river. He says I’m not to fraternize with the help. But what makes him truly furious is when I converse with Yan and Fred. He claims a well-born lady should not mix with men of lower rank. That doing so undermines his rightful authority over them. Perhaps once the summer swelter begins to fade he’ll become more tolerable.<br><br>The 20th of Feainn<br><br>The boredom weighs heavier and heavier upon me. I love my brother and am glad we did not sell the estate after our parents died, but at times I daydream of what it would be like to live somewhere else, with other people…<br><br>The 43rd of Feainn<br><br>We’ve a guest. He’s the son of a lord from somewhere near Gors Velen. A hunt took him across our land and he asked for lodging. Oh, what joy!

I hope Humbert will be pleased!<br><br>The 18th of Lammas<br><br>I told Humbert about Roderick and me. He flew into a rage. He said that match was out of the question. Perhaps I can convince him otherwise.<br><br>The 21st of Lammas<br><br>Humbert remains implacable, but I shan’t abandon the love of my life for him. If I’m left with no other choice, I will run away with Roderick.

   1080376|0fa15878||A frail ribbon flickers across the sky, the Riders' spectral silhouettes barely discernible within it. Then the cavalcade contorts closer and closer, revealing more and more of their ghastly form. Now the buffalo horns atop their helms penetrate one's view, now the crest betwixt them, and now the skull-like face exposed beneath their visors. The Riders sit astride skeletal mounts, bits of barding stuck to their sides like boils. A furious gale howls through the willows. Their blades now glisten like unfailing stars in the black sky. The wind howls louder and louder. No. That is no wind. That is ghoulsong. Suddenly the nightmarish cavalcade twists once more, the hooves of its ghostly mounts churning the light of will o' the wisps hanging above the bog.<br><br>At the head of the cavalcade rides the King of the Hunt. A rust-eaten bascinet sways above a skull-like mask. Gaping eye sockets burn with a pale blue fire. Around him whirls a tattered cloak. A necklace rattles atop his rust-covered breastplate. Holes empty as the abyss stare out from it - once they were filled with precious stones, but these fell out during his race across the skies and became stars. The King of the Hunt laughs, his teeth, rotten as the grave, snapping above the rusted collar of his breastplate. The blue flames in the eye sockets of his skeletal mask roar.

But today, why, he's outdone himself today.<br><br>I look, and there's Musky, running in from the field carrying something in his mouth. I think, "Maybe it's a hare, and I'll be able to whip up a stew, sell the fur?" But no, it was a sack. All covered in blood, so no wonder he sniffed it out. I look inside... and inside there's a key. A little one, all engraved and ornamented, like it fits some fancy chest or box. So I think, "Maybe there's treasure hidden hereabouts, and that's what this key's for?" So I think I'll go for a walk, see what I can see. If I find it, I swear to Melitele, Musky's going to eat nothing but veal for the rest of his days!<br><br>That blood on the sack's got me a bit worried, though...

   1080640|128e5120||Fair Novigradians! Let it be known far and wide that Klaus Fetterling is a liar, a fraud and a swindler. The "miraculous hair-growing formula" he sells is nothing more than well water from the Bits dyed with a modicum of lilac extract. The only effect imbibing this concoction is likely to bring about is a debilitating case of diarrhea which will keep you running to the outhouse day and night - a fact which I had the dubious pleasure of learning through first-hand experience. Therefore, if this shameless cheat should pay a visit to your domicile, buy nothing and instead tell him to go suck down his own remedy.<br><br>–- Volker Ollinger

   1062862|12e55f34||Your Most Honored Grace, the Duchess of Arcsea!<br><br>[illegible fragment]… The witcher Gerd feared Your Grace’s wrath, feared Your Grace’s righteous fury, so off he fled to Skellige, to that hive of pirates, thieves and other such bandits. In sooth, the gods must have smiled on our quest, for quickly did we catch his foul scent and track him to a public house near the village of Fyresdal, where he was banqueting with the locals. Some sought to protect him, treating the traitorous man as a companion in arms. We therefore showed them no mercy and burned the inn to the ground. Alas and alack, the witcher escaped us once again, but we tracked him to the ruins of the old fortress called Etnir, where he went to hide or else perchance lay in wait by some monster... [illegible]<br><br>We made haste to assault his position with all our strength, but still the treacherous foe slew five of my men, wounded me most severely and brought the ruins' roof collapsing down on us with some witchcraft. Never fear, we shall surely free ourselves from here soon. Meanwhile I have ordered the vile witcher's campsite searched and have found a diagram for some highly curious weapon. It is enclosed with this writing, entrusted to Your Grace's safekeeping. Another day, perhaps two, and we shall dig ourselves out of this rubble and catch the witcher. If fate is kind, perhaps I shall next send Your Grace not a missive, but the witcher's scalp... [illegible]<br><br>...yet it must be said that from the very start he slighted Your Grace with his most rude and brusque manners, though it is beyond the reasoning of a simple knight such as I to comprehend how a base worm like that could dare refuse Your Duchessness anything! Why, serving Your Most Graciousness is an honor, and anyone who shuns such service reveals himself as a simpleton and a knave. Thank all the heavens the gods watch over Your Graceful Being, and the merciless usurper, that twisted wretch who deems himself your father, could be ripped off his stolen throne without the need for that mutant’s help. Yet it is a witcher’s swiving employ, Your Grace, if you will pardon my Temerian, to kill monsters, and Your Good Grace’s father, why, what was he, if not a beast, a murderous monster lapping up the blood of innocents? And since he was such a monster - though draped in human skin, revealing his monstrous form only through deeds and not demeanor - the witcher ought to have killed him, as Your Grace asked of him. Therefore, it is just that said freak shall pay with his neck for violating the dictates of honor and witcher law alike.<br><br>Your Grace’s humble servant <br> Chalimir of Black Frydland, of the Brant banner

   1062863|149a37d3||...that was right before dusk. Then a witcher showed, dirty and unshaven and stinking worse than a fisherman from Faroe. Asked for a room and a bucket of water so's he could freshen up some. First I didn't want to let him in, on account of the bloody sack he was carrying, but then it came out he had arranged to meet Jorgen Iron Hand here - and a friend of Jorgen's a friend of mine...[illegible]<br><br>Sun had long set by the time Jorgen showed. Witcher handed him that sack and we all learned why it stank so bad - inside was the head of a siren. Jorgen had contracted the witcher to take it down after it attacked some folk in a cave in the northwestern part of Spikeroog. Seeing it dead cheered folk awful fast, and Jorgen, happy as a clam, started buying everybody rounds. The witcher refrained at first, saying he was off to take care of a striga that'd infested the ruins of a fortress on the northern edge of the isle, but in the end he gave in - after all, there's no refusing Jorgen...[illegible] <br><br>...made a lovely heap of coin that day, for the sun started rising and not a man had gone home. The witcher got drunk with Jorgen and started telling us tales, then we sat down for some gwent. That Gerd, he might be a first-class warrior, but he's one lousy card player. Lost half his reward for that siren to me (and drank the other half), then, wanting to win it back, he wagered a diagram for some kind of steel sword. To my eye it was a scrap of rubbish, but fuck it, some things you gotta do for the sake of sportsmanship and camaraderie, so I accepted the wager...[illegible].

Summer was short, and fall's just started and already we've had the first frosts. Got men digging in hardened ground. They plant millet or barley, but they won't harvest much of either. Panic's setting in on Undvik. "Winter's coming," or so say the old timers huddled around their fires. Everyone avoids saying "Ragh nar Roog," as if the words themselves could bring disaster. But everyone senses the last battle's leaping ever closer towards us. To my mind, long as the giants still sleep, we've hope yet. Aye.... we've hope yet...

   1062874|1803e911||My dearest Ingerborga,<br><br>[illegible fragment] … arrived at Fort Tuirseach on summer’s first day. He tarried there a while, draining more than one barrel of mead with the jarl. Soon both were fast friends. Then one day Jarl Torgeir summoned me and ordered me to sail to Spikeroog with him, to show him to where the sirens were the thickest.<br><br>It’s no exaggeration, my little mountain goat, to say I’ve never met a warrior like him in my life. He’s lithe as an eel and strong as a bear! When the sirens came at us, I hadn’t even time to seize my axe before he’d gutted them all. And his weapon, why, I’ve never seen its like – a crossbow, but so small he wields it with one hand. I know he has a sketch of it in his saddlebags, for I spied it when he was packing up. Once he's asleep, I'll try to sketch a copy to take to our smith on An Skellig, so he can make others. So we can protect ourselves from the sirens, case they return. <br><br>[illegible fragment]… soon as dawn breaks, we’re off, sirens are swarming thicker and thicker, my hands are numb from so much sword-swinging and my breath’s ragged, but thinking of you gives me strength… [rest of letter illegible]

During the after-hunt feast Crach announced he wanted to patch things up between Clans an Craite and Tordarroch. To seal this new brotherhood, they've planned a joint raid on Nilfgaard.<br><br>This is a good sign for Undvik. This friendship will help us through tough times. And they say tough times are on their way.

First to disappear were these two fishermen who tied off to the coast in a storm and decided to wait out the squall near the tower. Next a scouting patrol, five warriors strong, disappeared right around there. Jarl Tordarroch sent his strongest men out to look for them. And they never returned either. They say it's all the fault of Tor Gvalch'ca. And I think they might be right.

It shouldn't have taken more than a few days to heal over... but something got in my blood. Wound's full of pus, stinks. I'm losing feeling.

Our family's got a great many enemies. I've defended you against them, but now you'll be on your own. Perhaps someone will help you - and perhaps not. That's why I've had part of our goods hidden - in Old Ule's house, under the floorboards. That way no one can take it from you, no one can steal it - and you can dig it up once you're all grown. I've asked your mother to give you this letter when you start your eighteenth spring.<br><br>You take that silver, son. Buy yourself a fine blade, some armor, a horse. Raid the Continent. Exact revenge on the men who did you wrong after my death. Make me proud.<br><br>I never told you this, but I've always felt it: I love you, Janne. I hope one day we'll meet in the halls of Freya's eternal green garden and you'll tell me about your life. The life I was not able to see.<br><br>You have my blessings, son.

Only her eyes, which were black as coal, revealed her true age.<br><br>At first everyone took Friedbjorg's ageless beauty to be a sign of the goddess Freya's favor. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. One day Jarl Bodvar returned early from a raid and discovered his wife had been kidnapping and murdering young girls, then bathing in their blood. The blood of the innocent maids washed away all signs of aging, changing when it touched her body into a thick, black fluid that smelled like rotting innards. When the jarl saw all those girls hanging from their legs, their throats slit, he flew into a rage and set fire to the castle. He stayed inside as he was burned alive - along with his cruel wife, all his retinue and his servants. But to this day you can still hear cries coming from the castle's ruins - as if Fridebjorg had never stopped her murders...

From this it clearly follows that the witcher is, in the very matter of his being, a defiler of nature, an immoral and loathsome degenerate, born from the darkest and rankest depths of hell, for only one such as the devil himself can derive pleasure from suffering and torment.<br><br>[note in margin]<br><br>The book is a key.

Skellige was then ruled by giants, whose favorite pastime was to engage in vigorous wrestling matches. One day a giant smashed another's head into the coast of Hindarsfjall so hard, it pushed part of the island underwater. Many centuries later, the village of Lofoten was founded here to take advantage of this convenient harbor.

   1061817|1c8e5a49||No one can claim to have traveled the Northern Realms who has not been to Novigrad. If I were forced to list what during my many meanderings has made the greatest impression on me, it would be precisely this great, and yet at the same time free, city.<br><br>A metropolis worthy of the Empire, its only flaw is that the civilization Nilfgaard carries within her has not yet enlightened it. That is why hordes of reactionary cultists of the Eternal Fire dwell in the midst of its excellent buildings and superb commercial infrastructure. One feels as though superstition is how the local Hierarch and his temple guard cement their power over the city dwellers. And many they are to control, for the city counts no less than thirty thousands of inhabitants.<br><br>While strolling through its fabulous port, surrounded by marvels of architecture, it is hard to imagine that centuries ago Novigrad was a mere minor elven townstead. When the city fell into the hands of the Nordlings, its problems grew exponentially, for as is well known the people of the North can do a great many things, but peaceful and orderly cohabitation is not one of them. And so Novigrad first belonged to Redania, and then fell under Temerian rule, until finally, after endless compromises and bargains, it at last became a Free City.<br><br>But is the city truly free? I dare to doubt it. Redanian influence makes itself felt too strongly on every street corner, and the fact that the city is located within Radovid’s territory speaks for itself...<br><br>While wandering the city’s streets I came across four water mills, eight banks and nearly nineteen pawn shops. There are also a great many houses of simple pleasures such as taverns and brothels, and Novigrad’s commitment to matters of faith is borne witness to by the fact that the city contains no less than - I kid you not - nineteen temples to the Eternal Fire!<br><br>What more can be said… I think Novigrad has all the makings of the capital of the world, and perhaps that is what it will one day become. First, however, someone needs to bring order to within her walls.

   1057890|1cf2f71a||Legend states that when Otkell, son of Hemdall, was sailing to Hindarsfjall, a terrible storm broke. Otkell called for his father’s help, but his father could not hear, for powerful thunder drowned out Otkell's voice. In despair Otkell began yelling for anyone who heard his cries to come to his aid. In reply, Freya descended and gave Otkell a set of pipes.<br><br>When the hero blew on them, the waves calmed, the storm passed and Otkell could safely reach the shore. When Hemdall learned of the help the goddess had given Otkell, he ordered him to raise a temple to her on the isle. Ever since that day, Skelligers have worshipped Freya, and the women of Otkell’s line have often chosen to become her priestesses.

   1079405|1d2272ee||... and so there was much rejoicing in the castle at the appearance of an itinerant monster slayer in the person of the witcher Gerd. Jarl Torgeir, whose face in the months since the death of his battle brother, Ingmar, had worn a listless and saddened frown, came alive with renewed strength. Jarl and witcher fast found common tongue, and soon were venturing on hunts together and hosting feasts at which there was no end to laughter nor bluster... [illegible]<br><br>...then Jarl Torgeir told Gerd of the hideous striga which prowled the ruins of Etnir, desecrating that once-proud fortress, which in happier times had stood a steadfast guardian of the northern expanses of Ard Skellig. The jarl's lament moved the witcher, who announced he would slay said beast. Yet witcher Gerd was a craftsman ever diligent and true, and so explained he first had to complete a prior contract and rid a cave on Spikeroog of sirens...[illegible]<br><br>And so the jarl gave Gerd a full pouch of coin and the services of Olven, Org's son, as a guide to take him safely to Spikeroog and, if the danger grew fierce, to fight the sirens at the witcher's side. His heart filled with gratitude, Gerd entrusted an armor diagram to the jarl, one he had long carried and held most dear, as a token of his sincere intent to return as soon as he had finished his allotted task...

Must not have wanted Clan Torrdaroch's jarl to discover the truth, because they covered their tartans with soot. Didn't expect our guard to be on the look out and for our folk to put up resistance. Four of ours died, two of theirs. Clearly Lugos has gotten bored of raiding the Continent and is looking for loot closer to home. One thing's certain: if it's war he wants, it's war he's gonna get.

The coven gathering the worst of them - the knab of those utterly depraved and swollen thick with the pus of magic - was the Lodge of Sorceresses.<br><br>The first fiends of this Lodge were Philippa Eilhart, Lady of Montecalvo, Triss Merigold of Maribor, Keira Metz of Carreras, Margarita Laux-Antille, Síle de Tansarville of Creyden, Sabrina Glevissig of Ard Carraigh, Fringilla Vigo of Beauclair, Francesca Findabair and Ida Emean, elven women, Assire var Anahid and Yennefer of Vengerberg.<br><br>On the summit of Bald Mountain they gathered, witches all, to swear fealty to their devils and demons, their masters and lovers, and to promise to bring doom upon those living in peace in the Northern Realms. ‘Twas they who stood behind the murders of Demavend, King of Aedirn, Foltest, King of Temeria and many other noble men besides. ‘Twas they who brought about the outbreak of yet another war with Nilfgaard. ‘Twas they who sent plague and pox against decent, gods-fearing folk.<br><br>Yet take comfort, dear reader, for their deeds shall not go unpunished. Our gracious leader Radovid, fifth of his name, saw through their lies and swore their deaths, deaths as inevitable as they shall be painful.

   1080562|218dee11||Breaking in a horse's psyche is a simple matter of instilling your will as the rider into your mount, acquiring its trust and training its obedience. Horses are intelligent, noble beasts, so they should be treated with tenderness and a decisive and firm energy.<br><br>Mayer, the unquestioned authority in this area, emphasizes that when training one's mount a rider must eternally on the lookout for errors in the training itself. Every time the taming process ends in failure, the rider must look for the blocking error first of all in the his own actions, secondly in the horse's anatomy and only in a last resort by concluding the horse has a naturally difficult temperament.<br><br>Adhering to this principle protects one from undue punishments, which destroy the possibility of reaching an understanding between rider and mount and make it impossible to gain the animal's trust.

We'll show you how to defend yourself from witchcraft, how to tame and snuff out magic elements with dimeritium. We'll instruct you how to chase out a sinner's darkest secrets with a hot iron, and how to grant them cleansing death with the help of sacred fire.

I swore a hundred times that we'd split the booty from this raid as we've split the others - evenly. And I meant it. Thing is, two chests of jewels, a silver dagger and some gold cups and plates have gone missing. I summoned all from the clan who were on the raid - and all swore on the blood of their fathers, and their father's fathers before them, that they'd not taken more than their share.<br><br>That leaves Ingvar.

   1062471|22af4eaf||I, the undersigned George of Kagen, a witcher by trade, testify the following.<br><br>While traveling through Velen I received a summons to provide professional testimony in the matter of the accused Bartoslav of Luvfield.<br><br>This Bartoslav stands accused of causing several shipwrecks near the lighthouse which it is his duty to keep. Ships led astray by errant signals from his lighthouse have repeatedly smashed against rocks near the shore, and the lighthouse keeper is held to be responsible for this state of affairs. During the trial Bartoslav testified that he was diligent in the fulfilment of his duties and that the accidents were caused by nightwraiths deceiving sailors with their false glow.<br><br>Having investigated the area, I can testify that I found no trace of nightwraith activity. There are likewise no signs of noonwraiths, mamunes, errnymphs or any other specters in the habit of misleading weary travelers journeying by foot, sea or horse.<br><br>I did, however, find the catastrophes’ true cause. They were not the fault of the nightwraiths blamed by the accused, but neither were they the fault of the lighthouse keeper himself. The accidents were caused by local hooligans who have taken to lighting fires on the hill at night and then robing the ships that subsequently wreck upon the shore. I was put on their trail by Bartoslav’s son, who showed me the ashes from their misleading fires.<br><br>My testimony shows that the lighthouse keeper Bartoslav of Luvfield is not guilty of the crimes of which he is accused and should be let free. I also humbly ask for the bailiff to put the lighthouse keeper and his family under his protection, for in light of the revelations Bartoslav’s son led me to discover, there will surely be certain parties with cause for vengeance. I cannot undertake the task of protecting the family myself, for I have accepted a contract to kill a dragon said to be lurking atop the Crookback Hills and so must return there posthaste to kill the beast and complete my task.<br><br>signed: George of Kagen, witcher.<br>transcribed by Vicenzo Stock, marshal to the royal prefecture in Gors Velen

Who knows, maybe he ran off? I'd rather that than something worse to have happened. Truth be told, I think about leaving here more and more lately, about going back to you and the young one.

   1063201|2464274e||Having heard rumors of a dragon, I raced at full speed to Velen. Sadly, I was dragged away from my hunt by the prefects of Gors Velen. They summoned me as an expert to solve the riddle of a string of shipwrecks suspected to be the work of nightwraiths. Hmph. Seems a dragon ravaging the countryside is a lower priority than blocked trade routes. Luckily I was able to solve the riddle of the lone lighthouse quickly and raced off after the dragon.<br><br>I learned that the peasants from the ravaged villages had taken shelter in the elven catacombs under Lake Wyndamer. Wise. Yet they were not wise enough to bring firewood… and so warmed themselves by burning elven manuscripts! It aches my heart to think what knowledge about the Alder Folk went up in those flames… At least a few of the manuscripts survived (including some highly interesting sketches of armor). Yet enough about that.<br><br>Eye witnesses have reported: ashen scales, height at haunches – 2 fathoms, length – 5 fathoms (addendum: estimated weight – approx. 14 quintals), able to maintain a high temperature in its bellows (dragon lungs) for longer than a quarter hour. Conclusion: we are dealing with a green dragon.<br><br>Commencing hunt.
   1057893|2469fff2||Modolf, progenitor of Clan Drummond, who was granted mastery over the isle of Undvik, unlike his brothers displayed no extraordinary abilities: he was neither wise nor especially brave, nor did he possess any particular gift which would make him a great individual. He resented Hemdall for not bestowing greater talent upon him. Hemdall, however, insisted he had blessed each of his sons with equal gifts, but not all revealed themselves at once - Modolf would have to wait for the right moment for his gifts to step forward. Yet the hero was impatient and could not wait for this moment. Instead, again and again he sought out trouble of the worst sort, hoping each time his hidden talent would shine. Hemdall grew angry with his son and decided to bury his gift even deeper. Modolf died after a long and unruly life filled with incredible adventures, but a life during which he never discovered his talent. His descendants seek it to this day, looking for that which Hemdall hid from them.

   1062893|2618ffed||May the gods smile on you and me sis. Now I'm asking you to read this careful, for what I got to say's important.<br><br>Soon as you set hands on this writing, gallop off to that fence Kramer what's based in Maribor. Tell him we've got some first-class gear and witcher sword diagrams to sell. Aye, I can see you now, scratching your head, or more likely your arse, and asking, "Did I hear that right?" You sure did - 'twas my luck to come to care for a witcher what got one foot in the grave and t'other hovering right above. I was sat there looking at the poor man suffer in agony, and thought to meself, "He don't need this kit and these papers where he's going, while for us, that's the fixings we need to get us started in the world of business, if we sell them for the right price, that is." Aye, I hear you fretting, so stop. I didn't take everything, in fact, nobody'll even realize ought of his shite's missing.<br><br>Sad, though, ain't it - this witcher's a good man. First he helped the baronet solve the riddle of that lighthouse what was sending ships into the rocks, then he killed that dragon ate all the peasants. Problem is, a dragon's no easy pickings, and our valiant hero got quite the licking taking it out. He's done for, that's certain, so soon as they bury him in the tomb on Crookback Hills, I'll head straight to your place. Come to think of it, I'm curious how they'll put him in that crypt at all, for word is a vampeer's made it his lair.<br><br>P.S. I also lifted a few flasks off the witcher, but since they're like not to survive the journey, reckon I'll sample them myself, see how witcher hooch goes down - maybe we'll make a business out of that, too!<br><br> Your brother-in-law, A.

I hired a gang of dwarven loggers not long back to harvest lumber. Strapping lads, every last one having cut down many a mighty tree in his life. So you can imagine my surprise when said loggers disappeared, all save one, and he claimed to have seen a monster.

   1055856|29506402||Yennefer, my dear friend,<br><br>Thank you for your letter. Forgive me for not answering your earlier attempt to reach me via megascope. I am trying to limit my magic communication to the absolute minimum. One never knows who's listening, don’t you agree?<br><br>I am delighted you have found a position at our gracious emperor's court and wish you the best of luck in the search for his daughter. It is good to know that Emhyr's intentions for her have become more, how shall I put it, mundane. Perhaps in these circumstances an agreement regarding the Lodge will prove possible after all?<br><br>In response to your first question, I can state beyond all doubt that Ciri has not appeared anywhere south of the Yaruga. Believe me, I could recognize her magic signature in my sleep.<br><br>I have not had any contact with Triss for a long time. I only know that things in Novigrad have taken an ill turn. She mentioned something earlier about fleeing to Kovir, but I am afraid that in the current political climate that amounts to an impossible daydream.<br><br>I hope I will soon be able to join you in Vizima. First, however, I must take care of some unfortunate yet urgent matters in Beauclair.<br><br>With my fondest regards,<br><br>Fringilla Vigo<br><br>P.S. Thank you for the news about Geralt.

I build a house - not a year goes by and lightning strikes, burns the whole thing down. And the one time, ONE time fortune smiles on me and I return from a raid with some prime loot... A griffin flies down and makes its nest right on the summit of the mountain, right where I hid the treasure! Guess I should be happy it's not a gold fucking dragon, for fuck's sake!<br><br>But so be it. Not the first wind to blow in my eyes. I'll chase it off. Even if I die trying!

Got a visit from that witcher the baronet summoned about them evil powers took over the lighthouse and were crashing ships against the rocks. He stood there in the doorway to my forge, looking noble as a prince or duke or something, and said his silver sword got damaged during his last job. Blade was chipped bad, almost broken in two spots. I asked how he expected me to know how to fix a weapon like that, and he gave me a diagram and said I was to forge him a new one, and promised quite the sum in return.<br><br> ...damn near tuckered myself out making that thing! Aye, I did my apprenticeship with Master Barnaby of Novigrad and I've made a witcher blade or two in my life, but it's been over three years since I last touched anything of the sort. In the end didn't matter, though - afore I could finish, the witcher figured out what was going on with the lighthouse and had to make haste to the baronet's castle, for... [rest illegible]

And if work is scarce round Kaer Trolde as well, lend Singa a few coppers, at least, and I'll give it all back with interest once we're out of this plight.<br><br>With belief in your good heart and thanks in advance,<br> <br>Your loving mother

   1087427|2fea3fab||An Skellig is a weary travelers paradise. Those seeking respite from the hustle and bustle of urban life need look no further. Those yearning for peace, quiet and transcendental views - the kind that leave one short of breath and renewed in spirit - will find satiation on this isle. Here one may enjoy long walks along the most charming beaches in the isles, ones whose beauty far outshines that of the decidedly overrated coasts of Kovir.<br><br>Yet the true jewel of An Skellig is its port, which is famed for its skilled craftsmen, considered by many to be the best in the isles. An Skellig's shipbuilders have passed down the secrets of their trade from generation to generation for centuries, perfecting it into something which can proudly and with no exaggeration be called an art. Naturally, as a result one must wait twice as long for a vessel ordered from the local shipwrights than when ordering from lesser workmen.<br><br>Lastly, it would be a crime to discuss An Skellig without mentioning the superb (and surprisingly sophisticated!) local cuisine. Its specialty: sturgeon roasted to golden perfection in a sea-salt crust and served with carrot shavings and a sprinkling of mint. Sadly, this dish, once a mainstay of every tavern and seaside fish-fry, now has become a rarity due to the overfishing that caused a dramatic decline in the population of that most delicious of fish.

Though confusingly incorrect, the name stuck and now the city's residents never think twice about its illogical appellation.

   1061875|3123eb57||(…) Which brings us to the current ruler of Redania’s epithet - “the Stern.” Allow us to diagnose the causes and consequences of this appellation.<br><br>Firstly, the seeds of Radovid’s Sternness were surely planted in his childhood. When Radovid was born to King Vizimir and Queen Hedwig in 1255, his care was immediately entrusted to Philippa Eilhart, the court sorceress. While none would question her fitness for the role of tutor, few can envisage her as a warm caregiver for a young child - and whatever harsh lessons she gave Radovid clearly left a lasting mark.<br><br>The next step on Radovid’s path to becoming Stern? The death of his father at the age of 13. Although rumor has it father and son barely knew each other, the mere fact of being thrust into one’s inheritance at such an early age and in such murky circumstances must have had a hardening effect.<br><br>Finally, the regency finished Radovid’s schooling in the Stern. Led by Dijkstra of Tretogor, the Regency Council imparted upon Radovid a style of politics seeped in that man’s aggressive, no-holds-barred, reason-of-state-first principles.<br><br>Such are the causes of Radovid’s temperament - now on to the consequences. Most manifestations of his fierce manner are well known: his summoning of the Order of the Flaming Rose to be his armed enforcers, his later support for the witch hunters in their zealous cause and the massacre at Loc Muinne are but a few examples.<br><br>Yet it is in the fight against Nilfgaard that Radovid has proven himself truly Stern. While the forces of other realms have disintegrated in the face of the Empire’s onslaught, he has strengthened his kingdom and taken command of the Northern forces. Whatever their opinion of him before, all clear-eyed observers in the North now agree: Radovid V the Stern is the North’s last bulwark against Emhyr’s expanding power.
   1080885|3127d709||To Folk Far and Wide, <br> I've told you all plenty of times but never put it in writing, as I'm doing now, so that none may hide behind a defense of ignorance. My boy Pomir's sworn to the great mother Melitele that he'll never touch beer nor spirit again for as long as he lives. And it's a good thing he has, for when he lost our goat, hens, butter churn and the very breeches he was wearing in a game of cards two weeks back, I was mighty tempted to toss him out on his bare arse, or at least give it a thorough hiding. So if anyone spies Pomir walking towards a tavern, come see me at once, and you'll get a Novigrad crown for your trouble. Likewise, if I see any man encouraging him to drink, offering him a pint or a snifter of anything, then that scoundrel will learn that a hoe fit for more than just ploughing.<br><br>–Lillimira

In order to recognize the individual administering it, it makes use of a portal mounted at the entrance of the area it is to defend. This portal passes streams of magical energy through the body of the person entering and can, in the blink of an eye, determine if this person has the corporeal signature (eyeball structure included) of the entitled administrator. As a result, the only unauthorized individuals that can possibly hope to enter are mimics.<br><br>DRM thus makes for an extremely effective and near-unbreakable security measure - but you are in luck, for you hold in your hands the key to bypassing it, namely the present tome, Gottfried’s Omni-opening Grimoire, or GOG for short.

Our lads will defend us to their last bolt and last drop of blood, but you, too, need to be prepared to serve your fatherland. Steel and blood aren't the only things a man can wield in the fight for Redania - a wary eye and a cocked ear do battle just as well. So if you see a stranger hanging about your village, or someone hiding in the bush, or you hear someone talking with a foreign accent, send an envoy to the nearest outpost at once, because you might've just spotted a Nilfgaardian spy. Do this, and you not only serve Redania, but you enrich yourself as well, for we will reward all such help as generously as it deserves.<br><br>Together, shoulder to shoulder, onwards, to victory!<br><br>–Captain Vit Freyman

   1058823|38306aee||Love knows no bounds, the saying claims. History knows no better proof of this adage than the romance between Lara Dorren and Cregennan of Lod.<br>She – a powerful elven Sage, bearer of the Elder Blood, promised to the great Avallac’h. He – a human mage of great talent and humble birth. She – able to live centuries, if not millennia. He – likely to live no more than three score years and ten, like each of us. They should have hated each other, scorned each other. Instead, they burned for one another with powerful love.<br>Heedless to the war raging around them, to the condemnations and curses raining down on them from all sides, they led a humble and happy life. Soon Lara was with child. A babe born of Lara and Cregennan might have joined the best of both races, united them at long last. Alas, this was not to be.<br>Humans considered Cregennan a traitor and a renegade. They demanded he abandon Lara - and when he refused, they decided to murder them both. Cregennan died, while Lara, still heavy with child, escaped with her life. She ran to Tretogor, to beg succor and support from Cerro, Queen of Redania.<br>What then came to pass? Here elven and human sources diverge, presenting two irreconcilable versions. According to the chroniclers of the Aen Seidhe, ”…Her pleas did not soften the stony dh’oine hearts, the hearts of merciless and cruel humans. When Lara, pleading for mercy, if not for her, then at least for her child, clutched on to the door of the royal carriage, the queen ordered her maimer to strike with his sword and cut off her fingers. That night, crushed by a fierce frost, Lara breathed her last sigh, on a hill, in the woods, giving birth to a daughter whom she protected with the fading embers of her own warmth.” Human legends, however, have Cerro saying, ”Ask not me for grace, ask instead those whom you have harmed with your magic. Brave you were when you wrought those foul deeds, brave be you now, when the pursuit of justice nears. Your sins are not in my power to forgive.” In reply, Lara said, "My doom is at hand, but yours, queen, is also nigh. Remember Lara Dorren in that terrible hour, queen, remember her death and her curse. And know that my curse will hound you and your seed, to the tenth generation will it damn your line.”<br>Wherein lies the truth cannot be said. Both versions are surely false, for both seek to blacken their enemy. Sad is Lara’s end - the hate between races which Cregennan wished so badly to end is now so strong that its darkness has forever obscured the truth of her fate.

Well, he might've been right about that... but there's still the peasants themselves, and in Nilfgaard, they're fungible goods. We've already broken bread with a fellow who rounds up men for the Nilfs. We threw him a few hayseeds we'd found wandering the woods - he paid top coin for each and said to keep them coming.<br><br>So we're preparing a manhunt the likes of which Velen's never seen. Like any proper hunting party, we've split into two groups. We're camping out here, while the rest are west of Crow's Perch. We'll all go at the same time, from two sides, so no one can run away.<br><br>Funny, aren't they - life's surprises. When we were with the baron, we thought them peasants were worthless dung.

The sagacious Elementalist who has tamed a magic Minion should not heed the sweet yet pernicious Urge to unbind the Being, for only Harm will come of it, Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth will be the only result. Likewise he who tightens his Servant's yoke overmuch will gain nothing from it, for his enchained Being will be to him dumb and dull as a Lump of Earth.<br><br>The Key is to prepare a proper magic Barrier, one whose effectiveness shall be backed by a crystal of power. This crystal is of the utmost importance: if it should break, the barrier shall fail, yet worry not overmuch, for neither axe nor blade can harm it. A barrier thus secured shall serve as the Minion's Prison without unduly hindering its Power.

   1081035|3eee3354||Good folk of Skellige, last week in the moors I found a man. Not moving a bit, so figured him for a stiff. Turned out he was breathing, but was so drunk he had booze instead of blood in his veins. I did not want him to freeze, for while it may be spring, the nights are still cold, so I took him to my house. The moment he sobered up a bit he drank my whole supply of mead, ploughed my wife and stole my brother's horse. I'm warning you, if you ever meet a drunkard called Odrin, best slay him on the spot and avenge me!

   1076406|3fc4655e||Despite what you might have heard, the first golem was created not by a powerful mage or an elven Sage, but by a simple dwarf from Maribor named Bonaventura Sesto - a brickmaker.<br><br>The fateful act of creation took place over a century ago, when the persecution of nonhumans was in full swing in Maribor. Elves and dwarves had been accused of bringing an epidemic to the city - though it was later discovered the outbreak had been caused by a man named Mattheo, a barkeep's dogsbody at the Golden Goose Inn. This Mattheo was charged with both serving meals and cleaning the latrines, and would only wash his hands once a month, and then not very thoroughly. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>The persecution of nonhumans was limited at first to robbing their shops, arson and the occasional beating, but the violence soon escalated into a bloody pogrom. As the city guard looked on without lifting a finger, humans murdered elves and dwarves during three days and three nights of slaughter, killing over three hundred individuals, including the aforementioned Bonaventura Sesto's entire family.<br><br>Driven mad with grief and thirsting for vengeance, Bonaventura molded a ten-foot-tall humanoid out of clay, and then carved the names of the slain nonhumans onto it, along with a smattering of dwarven curses. Once finished, he slit his own throat - and when his blood splattered his gigantic statue, it came alive and started walking towards the city. Bonaventura had his sweet revenge on his persecutors - his creation killed almost five hundred humans, including the mayor and the entire city council, before the soldiers from the city garrison could take it out using their ballista.<br><br>The Conclave's later investigation found that Bonaventura had possessed hidden magic talent. Though he had never had any training, the torrent of powerful emotions running through him at the time of his death flushed out his latent powers and created from them a new spell. After numerous alterations and improvements, one can now cast this spell without sacrificing one's life - and golems guard laboratories, libraries and palaces across the Continent.

   1084572|40e8f83a||The disciples of the Isles' local pantheon are not the sole spiritual devotees in Skellige, for some druids also call the archipelago home. Yet this is no cause for conflict, for Freya's adherents and the Druids' Circle coexist and treat each other with great respect. What welds these two faiths together? A common worship of the divinity found in the earth, fertility, love and birth. To the druids, men form a part of nature and should treat the world around them with the utmost respect. They hold that since nature gave life, her most precious gift, to humans and the other civilized races, they should live in harmony with her, yielding their will to hers.<br><br>Druids are seen as wise men and priests and are held in high esteem by society. They act as spiritual guides, herbalists and alchemists. Skelligers seek their counsel in times of trouble, summon them when ill and ask them to settle thorny conflicts. Like their continental brethren, the druids of Skellige have a Circle - an area set aside in their holy grove where they assemble, meditate and study sacred tomes. Many druids are capable of wielding magic.

    469930|41c39c80||Then the fairy said to the witcher: "I will tell you what to do: put on a pair of iron shoes, pick up an iron staff. Walk in the iron shoes to the end of the world, pat the ground before you with the staff, and sprinkle it with tears. Walk through fire and water, do not stop, do not look back. And when your shoes wear out, and when the iron staff shatters, when the wind and the heat dry your eyes so that you cannot shed another tear, then you will have reached the world's end, and you will have found what you seek and what you love. Perhaps."<br><br>And so the witcher walked through fire and water without looking back. But he took neither the iron shoes nor the staff. He took only his witcher's sword. He did not heed the words of the fairy. And that is good, for she was an evil fairy.

   1064143|4479910e||Location: Amavet fortress<br>Persons taking part: Sir Ignatius Verrieres, Bart., the bailiff Andreas Blume, Sir Ignatius’ underlings: Carmy, Gardy and Bellsy.<br>Suspect: Kolgrim, witcher of the Viper School.<br><br>The witcher Kolgrim stands accused of kidnapping Vitty, son of Paul, a beekeeper residing in White Orchard. Suspect was detained pending trial. Upon detention he was searched and a diagram for the forging of a steel sword was found on his person. It is suspected this sword was used to intimidate or possibly kill the kidnapped child. It is likewise suspected that the accused possesses other such diagrams for the forging of death-dealing implements, though none have been found to date. Sir Ignatius has requested the witcher undergo preliminary interrogation with the application of torture. This will take place once a torturer with the proper qualifications has been found.<br><br>Addendum:<br>It was later discovered drowners were responsible for the boy’s disappearance. Unfortunately Kolgrim died before this information reached the investigators, for rather than face the baronet's judgment, he chose trial by ordeal. Sir Ignatius agreed and ordered he cleanse the Verrieres family crypt of specters. Kolgrim never emerged from said crypt. It is highly likely the motley wraiths, specters and evil powers residing therein proved too much for him.

    519864|46072d3c||Most historians ascribe the trial, sentencing and execution of Joachim de Wett to the violent, cruel and tyrannical nature of Emperor Emhyr, although many authors with a predilection for sensational prose propose loaded hypotheses about vengeance and the settling of thoroughly private scores. It is high time to tell the truth – the truth that is and has long been more than clear to every scholar.<br><br>Duke de Wett led the Verden Group in a manner for which the description “incompetent” would be far too delicate. Facing a force twice as weak as his own, he delayed the northern offensive, turning all his attention to the fight against Verden guerillas. <br><br>The Verden Group brought unheard of cruelties to bear against the civilian population. The result was as easy to predict as it was inevitable: whereas in the winter the insurgents numbered a mere half a thousand, by spring nearly the entire country was up in arms against us. King Ervyll, who was loyal to the Empire, was killed, and his son, Crown Prince Kistrin, who sympathized with the Nordlings, was made king.<br><br>With Skellige pirates at his flanks, the Nordling’s offensive from Cidaris in front of him and the rebellion to his rear, de Wett became bogged down in a chaotic struggle, suffering defeat after defeat. This in turn delayed the Central Army Group’s offensive – instead of tying the Nordling’s wings like it was supposed to, the Verden Group tied down Menno Coehoorn. The Nordlings immediately took advantage of the situation and went on the counterstrike, breaking through in a ring around Mayena and Maribor, thwarting any chance for a quick recapture of these important fortresses. De Wett’s ineptitude and stupidity also had importance for morale. The myth of Nilfgaardian invincibility was shattered. Hundreds of new recruits began to pour into the Northern armies…

On the way back to our keep, I stopped to rest the night in a village in the Temerian borderlands. The blasted peasants decided to make me into their scapegoat and accused me of kidnapping some beekeeper's brat. They took me in to the local lordling's castle for interrogation, during which they found and confiscated one of the diagrams. But do not fear, I will get it back. They did not find the others.<br><br>I have invoked Temerian common law and demanded a trial by ordeal instead of submitting to the whims of this baronet. My request was granted and tomorrow I am to cleanse the baronet's family crypt of wraiths. I expect this will prove little trouble.

   1084570|46598d56||Leshens dwell in dense, primeval woods. Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals within in their territory – and so when stalking them, half the battle is merely getting near enough to strike. Leshens old enough to earn the appellation “ancient” wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.<br><br>Some leshens create magic totems that increase their strength – in such cases these totems should be destroyed before or while fighting them. Furthermore, some leshens can create for themselves a kind of immortality in the following way: the leshen wounds a lost traveler passing through its woods with its claws and casts a black magic curse on him. For as long as the individual marked in this way stays near its territory, the leshen will be reborn every time it dies. Such leshens can only be defeated by driving away or killing the person they have marked.<br><br>In combat leshens use not only their long claws but also their many allies: wolves, who unfailingly answer their call, or ravens, which harass and distract the leshen’s opponent. Leshens are also able to bend plant life to their will and make it aid them in battle. It is a witcher’s good fortune that leshens do have one weakness - they are extremely vulnerable to the Igni Sign.

   1028299|471c2178||Captain's log for the Amuanda<br><br>Day 69, Elinud<br><br>Hatred has set in for the guide and the foreign royal family he was hired to escort. I should never have agreed to give them passage. They've meant endless trouble from the moment we pulled out of Val, and all indications are that plenty more awaits ahead. The foreign royals' bizarre behavior does nothing to help - the crew calls them barbarians behind their backs and mutters about the expedition being cursed. The guide said he had been hired to take them to Beauclair - perhaps such strange customs will accord with those at Anna Henrietta's court, but first we must reach the Continent safely. Yet ever since we lost sight of our sister ship, I've had a bad feeling about our chances of doing so.<br><br>Day 73, Elinud<br><br>I might have known there would be trouble when the guide explained these royals were fleeing a coup that knocked them off their throne on their home island. I hear the woman speak to the child in that strange tongue of theirs. She spits out words whose very sound is so filled with hatred and contempt I need not guess at their exact meaning, for they are sure to be curses aimed at the usurper. She scans the horizon constantly, the dread plain on her face, no doubt fearing assassins have been sent after her.<br><br>Day 78, Elinud<br><br>My worries have been confirmed - our passengers will be our doom. The ship will soon sink. May our gods and theirs watch over us.

   1061002|47d04cd9||The last muster before marching out lasted three hours. Second Lieutenant von Dubb once again told us of the Sun Empire’s great triumph and the intricate politics of victory that required leaving Temeria to the Temerians. He made it clear that abandoning the occupied lands was essential to maintaining the empire’s territorial integrity, explaining it all in great detail, as if wanting to quell any doubts right from the start.<br><br>Of course, no one intends to ask any questions.

   1076842|48d3b97c||My Dear Helke!<br><br>Remember when you said, "Izbor, don't you go robbing folk, the gods don't like it, and besides, only refugees on the roads these days, and they're even poorer than us"? How you were cross that I shirked working in the fields and didn't bring a scrap home to put in the pot? Well, you are gonna have to eat those words, my dear! Gobble them all up, with a hearty slice of humble pie and some baked crow on the side!<br><br>Yesterday we cornered this merchant. And not a Gors Velen or Brenna man, but from Nilfgaard itself, you see? From the City of Golden Towers! Didn't speak much Common, but enough so's we could understand each other. He said he was carrying some goods to the Black One's camp. We took everything he had, and I'm telling you, Helke darest, you've never seen so many crowns in your life, nor could you ever hope to count that high!<br><br>Now we're going to rough him up a bit more to make sure he hasn't hid some of his gold or goods. Once we cut off his thumbs he'll spill the beans about any extra treats stashed in the soles of his boots, and once Mirko scalds him a bit he'll tell us about the precious stones he's got sewn in the feedbag. Might tell us a great many such things of interest, in fact. You never know just what till you try.<br><br>Tell the young'uns Da's gonna be home soon. That he'll bring them toys and treats and they'll eat so many honeycakes their tummies're gonna burst. For you, Helke, I'll bring a silver necklace and brooch. Because while you can be awful cruel atimes, I still love you, you naughty bint.<br><br>-Izbor<br><br>P.S. Throw on that nightshirt with the lace and red beads for my arrival. And color up your kisser somewhat.

   1055812|4910ea2a||Arnvald,<br>The great moment is nigh. Do not let me down, and I will shower gold and gratitude upon you.<br>You are to do the following. Before the feast, you will put the maerdrome mushrooms included in this letter into one of the barrels of mead, and then pour a measure of human blood in after them. You will give the drink thus seasoned to the Vildkaarls - it will cause them to transform. Note that they are not aware of our plan - that should remain the case to the very end. Think of the Vildkaarls not as allies, but as tools.<br>Once the deed is done, leave Kaer Trolde as quickly as possible. My men will await you on the beach as promised, and will hide you until matters calm.<br>Some will call you a traitor. A disgrace. Do not listen to those fools. You have shown great courage by standing on the right side of history.<br>Glory to Skellige,<br>The Future King

You can find me in my house after dusk, after I return from my day's fish. If you don't end up buying, we can still drink mead together.

   1086608|4d120428||Bastien, my brother, went off to fight the Black Ones. I've reason to think he stood in the great battle nearby. He's not returned to this day. Like many others, you'll say, and you'll be in the right. But if he fell, and I know it's like he did, I'd give him up to the ground the least, like our fathers have done always. I'd bury him 'neath the barrow where our parents lie, not leave his corpse to be ate by the corpsers prowling the battleground.<br><br>So I seek a man brave, able with a sword, and willing to venture out with me to find Bastien. I won't pay much, for I've not much to give, but I'm not stingy with gratitude and sure to show it aplenty.<br><br>Any man willing to help - look for a razed hut along the road to White Orchard, just near the bridge.

Daughter of Pavetta (see Pavetta Fiona Elen) and the Urcheon of Erlenwald (see Emhyr var Emreis). Granddaughter of the famous Lioness of Cintra, Queen Calanthe (see Calanthe Fiona Riannon).<br><br>A shipwreck occurred during a journey from Cintra to Skellige which took the lives of the Urcheon and Pavetta. Cirilla's further upbringing was then entrusted to her grandmother. In 1260, afraid of the looming Nilfgaardian threat, Queen Calanthe sent Cirilla to the court of King Ervyll (see Ervyll of Verden), where the heiress of Cintra was to marry the heir to the throne of Verden, Prince Kistrin (see Kistrin of Verden). Though allying with Verden and gaining the aid of that realm’s army was at the time Calanthe's top priority, no marriage ever occurred, and Cirilla returned to her grandmother's court. In 1262, during the so-called Cintra Massacre, Cirilla went missing (…).

   1059021|4f487aa0||Which Northern Realm’s special forces are the greatest of them all? Once upon a time, the answer was clear: Redania. Its network of spies and informers was so vast that Tretogor knew which route the Nilfgaardian armies would take before they even left their barracks. No ruler kept any weakness or comprising secret from these astute spooks. Redanian intelligence had vast resources at its disposal, including the use of great sorceresses like Philippa Eilhart and shining stars from the world of culture. With their innovative interrogation techniques perfected in Drakenborg Fortress, its agents could extract vital information from even the tightest-lipped Scoia’tael guerilla, allowing them to reduce that organization on their soil to a hounded, desperate few.<br><br>The golden days of the Redanian spy service ended, however, along with the disappearance of its head, Sigismund Dijkstra. His fate still remains unknown to this day. According to some, he departed for voluntary exile after falling out with King Radovid. According to others, he was captured by enemy agents. Still others hold that Dijkstra was murdered by sorceresses, and his body disintegrated into a fine dust.<br><br>After Dijkstra’s disappearance, the royal council ordered a thoroughgoing audit of the spy corps. Radovid appointed a commission with a remit to search for abuses of power, root out double agents and suggest remedial measures. As usual, however, inserting civilians into the affairs of spies had the opposite of the desired effect. Shortly after the work began a list of agents and their sources leaked. Many on it were subsequently murdered or fell off the face of the earth. A few days sufficed to reduce to ashes an organization built over long years of hard work.

   1057841|50e8dca3||Belief in the mythical snake Uroboros is widespread throughout all of Skellige. Winding itself up into a figure eight, the snake took its own tail between its teeth and in so doing created time. The circle of time will be complete when Uroboros once again bites its tail and closes the loop. This will commence the so-called<i>Final Age</i>, <i>Tedd Deireadh</i>, also called the <i>Time of the White Frost</i> or the <i>Wolven Blizzard</i>. It is thought many signs will foretell its coming - sources mention a wolf eating the sun and an eclipse of the moon. Next there will be a battle known as<i>Ragh nar Roog - the Last Battle, the Battle of Light and Dark</i>. It will begin with the appearance of a longship made of the claws of dead men and carrying an army of wraiths and demons. Standing watch for the coming of the longship in his hunting blind is a hero named Hemdall. The golden cockerel, Kambi, will warn of the longship's arrival, and then Hemdall will mount the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost, to stop the invading powers of darkness. As he goes to fight, Hemdall will sound his horn, and for Skelligers this will be the call to take up arms and join the Last Battle. This final conflict will decide whether eternal night will fall upon the world or a new dawn will rise.<br><br>A local legend recounts how all clans in Skellige can trace their lineage back to Hemdall. Supposedly one summer solstice he left his hunting blind and spied Heulyn, a goddess. They fell hopelessly in love and spent the entire summer together, yet when autumn came, Heulyn had to depart. That is why the summer months, when Heulyn stays with Hemdall in Skellige, are the most fortunate days in the Isles.<br><br>Six sons were born of Hemdall and Heulyn’s love, giving rise to the six clans of Skellige. Their father let them take one isle each, but before they did so, they had to prove their manliness in a fight for living space, by rooting out the aboriginal inhabitants or coming to an understanding with them. That is how the sons of Hemdall and Heulyn first gained renown, and the memory of their deeds is honored by their descendants, the members of the clans they founded.

   1068600|51851436||Dearest Lilly,<br><br>If you are reading this, that means both your father and I are dead. I have asked Egward to give you this letter only when it is certain neither of us will return.<br><br>A great deal happened while you were away at the Academy. One of your father’s ships sank and we fell into debt. I did not write you then because I did not want to worry you, did not want you to return – your education and future are what matters most to us. Our creditors began to call in our loans and refused to accept payment in installments. When we were forced to admit we could not return the entire sum, they swore to destroy us. Some thugs began following our every step, never letting us out of their sight. It was only a matter of time before the family secret was discovered. They directed the witch hunters to us and we were thrown in the dungeon. I heard the guards gossiping about how we are to have a show trial – and a show execution. I gave one my wedding ring and he agreed to allow Egward to visit us. Your father wishes to give him some final instructions and I want to give him this letter - our last, unexpected farewell.<br><br>Be strong, my sweet, for in your veins flows the blood of men and wolves, and with that comes responsibility. I forbid you to avenge us. That will not bring us life, and will only bring you the executioner’s axe. You cannot die, not in that way. You must prove with your life and conduct that men and lycanthropes can live together in harmony. Leave town as soon as possible. Take only what is necessary, say farewell to no one, do not show yourself in public. Journey to where we used to hunt when you were a young girl and brace for the worst. The people there surely do not remember us, but they are good, simple villagers – they will treat you with kindness. Let us hope the madness of this persecution will soon end and you will be able to return home. In the meantime, take care of yourself and do not let them provoke you. Remember who you are and do not let anyone convince you that is something evil – this is how you were born and you should be proud of it. Live for us. We love you.<br><br>Mother

Sometimes one the baron's blowhards come to us, but taking care of them's no trouble.<br><br>Since we're not in any particular hurry, I've decided to build us a new vessel instead of patching up the old dinghy. Why not? Best take advantage of the turmoil while it lasts. I hear there's a boatyard nearby - that'll do just fine. And while we wait for a new ship, I'll send men out to look around for Queen Zuleyka's famous treasure. If it's worth a tenth of what I've heard, we'll all be rich. Well, I will, at least.

At first I merely suspected it, but now I am certain: our ship is being followed.<br><br>We've charted a course for shore. The captain wants to replenish supplies in a small village called Ursten, and then sail up the Pontar. The masts of the ship which sails after us are constantly visible on the horizon.<br><br>The worst is upon us. We shall drown. The shore was within our reach when a horrible wind blew us back. The gale tossed our ship against the rocks. We're taking on water. The yard fell and crushed my legs. I don't know what will come to pass now. I have failed them, have failed the heirs to the royal dynasty whom I was charged to escort safely to Beauclair...

   1077700|5362d5e6||Dear Sir,<br><br>You were kind enough to share with me your doubts concerning the contract. You made it clear you believe it impossible for a man to turn into a nekker. You even drove the point home with a humorous comparison, saying, I believe, "same as a pig won't turn into a horse, not even if you strap a saddle on it and call it Black Beauty."<br><br>It is entirely possible that you are right. But if there exists even the shadow of a chance that my son has been imprisoned in the body of that monster, that some spell or curse has done this to him, then I will not rest until I try every possible way of helping him.<br><br>That is why I would ask you to refrain from further attempts at humor and keep your doubts to yourself. Instead, channel those energies towards doing the job for which you shall be paid. Catch the nekker, and collect your gold. The rest should not interest you.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br><br>-Robert de Mere

   1083693|548560bf||Winter was on its way and the lord once again started to think about what to do to oppress his people even more. One morning, at the crack of the cockerel's crow, he rode out into the village in a carriage pulled by two black horses, with his trusted page at his side to act as his scribe. The earth was sodden and a cruel mud covered the road, so the lord, not wanting to dirty his shiny new boots, stayed in his carriage and sent his page to do his bidding.<br><br>When they arrived at the village, the page dismounted from the carriage, a paper covered in thick ink clutched in his hands. He nailed the paper to the first hut he saw, and since he did it with a hammer, a peasant boy named Reuben soon opened the door up to see what was the matter. The boy was twelve years of age and had a straw-colored shock of cow-licked hair and a freckled-face with ruddy cheeks.<br><br>"Well? What do you want?" grumbled the page, looking at Reuben's shirt, which was covered in the same filth as everything else in the village.<br><br>"Well, uh, nuthin', rightly," Reuben shrugged, "Thing is, sir, this here's me home."<br><br>"Then get inside it." The boy wasn't scared, and instead stood on his doorstep looking at the piece of paper.<br><br>"S'what's this, sir? A letter?" the boy asked.<br><br>"Read it and find out for yourself," the scribe said, growing angrier, though Reuben didn't seem to notice.<br><br>"Afear'd I can't, sir. Don't know how."<br><br>"What the devil's taking you, scribe?!" the lord hollered. He was still sitting in his carriage and hadn't heard the conversation. Clearly, he was growing bored.<br><br>"The whelp says he doesn't know how to read!"<br><br>"Aye, 'cause he don't," Reuben confirmed and took two steps toward the carriage, his bare feet sinking into the muddy gray muck.<br><br>"And the ones inside, do they?" questioned the lord.<br><br>"Where d'ye reckon they'd learn a thing like that, m'lord?" the peasant asked, perplexed, for he had always thought great lords like that must surely know everything.<br><br>"So who in your village does know how to read?" asked the lord, growing ever more irritated.<br><br>"Not no one, m'lord."<br><br>"Scribe," the lord said, leaning far out while leaning on his carriage door, "Could you explain to me how I am to enforce my declaration on people who do not know how to read and write?"<br><br>"I don't know, my lord," the scribe said, taking a step back, as if he expected the lord to jump out of the carriage and assault him. The fault was not his, but the lord was in the habit of beating his scribe when he grew angry, no matter the cause.
   1057791|5488a0b0||As is true of most realms, the predominant religion in the Skellige Isles has its roots in the prehistoric cult of the Great Mother, Mother Nature. On the Continent, such worship has taken as its object and namesake Melitele. In Skellige, her counterpart is Freya.<br>Like Melitele, Freya is represented in three aspects - virgin, mother and old crone. That of mother is most common, and sculptors chose to depict her thus in her greatest sanctuary in the Isles. There she stands, a pregnant woman draped in loose robes, her face partially revealed, her head bent and her hands folded across her breast. A golden necklace hangs around her neck, and on it a large, pure diamond (<i>Brisingamen</i>) shines like a clear summer sky.<br>Freyja Modron, or Freya the Great Mother, is the goddess of fertility, love, beauty and abundance. She is also the patron of oracles, soothsayers and telepaths. Warriors pray to her before setting out on sea raids, and the wives they leave behind pray to her for their husbands’ safe return. Only priestesses serve the goddess – men may worship Freya, but only women may do her work. Freya’s priestesses, like the clerics of other cults, treat mages and sorceresses with great reserve.<br>The center of Freya’s worship is her temple on the isle of Hindarsfjall, in the sacred grove called Hindar. Worshippers place offerings to the goddess before her statue, on an altar that incorporates a great stone basin surrounded by figurines of cats and falcons - her sacred animals. In addition to this temple, sprinkled throughout the isles are other, smaller places where one can worship the goddess and make offerings to her (...).

   1061912|583570ac||A conviction has arisen amongst both mages and the hoi polloi that witchers barely rise a hair's breadth above animals, that they are deformed and bloodthirsty mutants, and that in slaking this thirst they do not limit themselves to the fluids of monsters. Meanwhile the research and observations of Virgil of Ban Ard paint an entirely different picture of the caste.<br><br>Of course, it is an indisputable fact that the mutations witchers undergo influence their temperament, immune system, strength and endurance, yet one cannot consider them unthinking beings forged only for killing as a result. In fact, witchers cultivate a unique culture, a specialized body of knowledge, an effective training system and even a code of honor. They know an incredible amount about the effects of ingesting various organic and inorganic substances, and also a small amount, but nevertheless something, about the fundamentals of magic (by which I mean the simple spells they call "Signs"). On the surface the witchers appear to be a homogeneous social entity, but in truth their fighting styles, training regimens and world views differ significantly depending upon the school to which they adhere. The best-known witcher schools on the Continent are the School of the Wolf, the School of the Bear, the School of the Griffin, the School of the Viper, and the School of the Cat.

   1073091|58f532dd||I'd always thought myself a simple trader, a man who buys here and sells there, and makes a bit of coin for himself in the doing. But yesterday I learned I constitute what's called a "strategic risk," and so cannot cross the bridge the Redanians control. Who knows what I have in my wagon, the sergeant said, maybe I'm smuggling weapons, maybe I'm carrying spies' reports? When I said they'd nothing to fear from my bundles of cloth and lace, and that the only letters I'm carrying are from my dear wife, the sergeant slapped me across the face with his glove and ordered me to, and I quote, "fuck off," or else I would soon "be seeing more stars than many an astronomer." As you can see, eloquence and good manners do not seem to be subjects of much importance at the Redanian officers' academy, though one must admit the soldier did display a certain amount of linguistic creativity.<br><br>Well, life goes on. I've hired a few mercenaries and a guide to help me ford across the river near the bridge. Once across, I'll blow that sergeant a kiss and continue on my way.

   1087439|595b28bc||5/20/1271<br><br>My Dear Gaspar,<br><br>We cannot rest on our laurels. True, we managed to convince the witcher to drink the concoction we had brewed without much difficulty, but now we must gather information. Somehow I doubt this Gerard, or whatever his name was, truly will truly keep an experiment diary, even if by some miracle he is literate. And without hard data, the Academy's governors will never renew our grant - believe me, I've been down that road before!<br><br>To keep one step ahead of events, I've already taken appropriate action. To be precise, while in Flotsam I hired a spy who will follow our witcher's every move and observe his deeds, especially those performed in the alcove. If our calculations are correct, within a year's time his sterility will be reversed - proof of which fact should come quickly in the form of expanding female bellies, if the rumors about him contain even a grain of truth.<br><br>The spy's wage is costly, true, but I'm convinced this investment will yield dividends. I believe a potion which restores the ability to reproduce to those who have lost it due to magic or alchemic experiments will be in high demand - and earn us a fortune.<br><br><i>Vivat Academia,</i><br>–Farid<br><br>P.S. Just remember - not a peep about this around the department, or the ethics committee will flay us alive.<br><br>P.P.S. I've received the spy's first report. The witcher is headed to Loc Muinne. Perhaps it's a good time to visit?

Dowry welcome, but not required.<br><br>–Lucille
   1057887|5d875152||Clan Tuirseach, master of An Skellig, was founded by a hero named Tyr. Legend has it that to take possession of the land promised him by Hemdall, his father, Tyr first had to defeat a great and powerful bear named Yngvar. It was well known that no mortal had ever survived an encounter with Yngvar, so Tyr decided to prepare properly for the fight. He ventured into the deepest cave in Skellige and with the fire of the bowels of the earth as his furnace, he forged a blade so fine it could slice a hair lengthwise and so strong it could fell a hundred-year-old tree in one blow and not be dulled. Heulyn, his mother, engraved protective runes upon the sword by the first light of dawn so that it would protect Tyr from the bear’s attacks. Yngvar was defeated, Tyr became master of An Skellig, and his descendants are one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in the Isles to this day.

   1063666|5ddb4060||None of the four Planes or Dimensions - those of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air - is accessible to mere mortals. They are inhabited, however, by creatures known as genies. There are four types, each corresponding to one of the four Elements which comprise their respective essences. Each type of genie also counts its antithesis among the others. Thus, the marides, aligned with the Element of Water, are opposed by the fiery ifrits. The Plane of Earth is inhabited by the d'ao genies, and the Dimension of Air which opposes it is home for d'jinni - whose name, incidentally, is the root of the word genie. This last term is often used by simple folk to refer to all creatures that inhabit the Elemental Planes, which is an obvious blunder…<br><br>Unusually powerful sorcerers can sometimes bind such beings and bend them to their will, thus acquiring tremendous might to the point of near omnipotence. For a genie, being the living personification of an Element's energies, is akin to an almost boundless reservoir of the Power. Thus, its master can draw energy from the genie for spell casting, without the tiresome need to channel from traditional sources. However, those who are able to bind a genie are few and far between, for the strength of the inhabitants of the four Planes is matched only by the cunning which they employ to avoid such a fate.

But I promise you, I swear on all the gods: everything which you shall read in the pages to follow is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<br><br>I met the vampire of which I write years ago, in an inn in Beauclair. He introduced himself to me as Regis and said he was a barber and a medic. Since he looked in every aspect like a mortal man, I might never have even suspected his true nature - had not a fire broken out shortly thereafter in the establishment in which we were residing. This Regis, if that truly was his name, stood completely untouched by the flames, whereas my own clothing quickly caught fire. The vampire carried me out of the burning inn, saving my life from certain death, then treated my numerous wounds.<br><br>At first Regis refused to answer my query as to how he had miraculously survived the furnace-like temperatures inside the burning inn without so much as a scratch on his body or a hair singed on his head. Eventually, however, he must have sensed I was a man of the world, one who would not jump to hasty judgments based on appearance or species, and revealed his identity - along with a great number of highly interesting facts.<br><br>According to Regis, not all vampires are alike. This vast family contains both mindless katakans, fleders and ekimmaras, who in form resemble overgrown bats far more than humans, as well as alps and bruxae, who look remarkably like comely maids. In addition to these, there are the even more powerful higher vampires, to which genus belonged my unexpected acquaintance.<br><br>Not even a witcher can discern a higher vampire from a mortal man. Contrary to popular belief, they cannot be killed by pounding aspen stakes into their chests nor by cutting off their heads, nor, as I can vouch for based on personal experience, by fire. They do not fear running water, garlic or the symbols of any creed. It might be some consolation to learn a vampire's bite does not turn a human into one of their number, and they do not in any way need our blood in order to survive - to them, it is merely a delicacy in which they indulge from time to time, like men do with fine wine.<br><br>Regis asked me to keep his tale to myself. But now, as I lay on my death bed, I feel that I must share this secret knowledge, even if it means breaking my word to this most noble individual...

Both species instinctively sense the presence of magic intersections and often choose them as resting places, which is strange, for other animals avoid these same spots. Numerous theories attempt to explain this behavior, but none do so with thorough success. Some scholars claim dragons use the Power they imbibe to fly - for as the natural philosophers have proven, no creature of their size and mass should be capable of lifting itself into the air using such meager wings.<br><br>As for cats, there is a theory stating the Power is behind their gift for seeing things in complete darkness. Others claim this ability is theirs by nature, and they use the Power of the intersections for other, unknown purposes. Indeed, that all members of the felidae genus are able to see beings from other planes, invisible persons and emanations of the Power has been proven beyond any doubt on numerous occasions.

   1076506|5fd99527||Twenty years of service have taught me this: never trust the equipment given to you by your quartermaster. Army smiths and armorers do everything en masse - meaning they do a shoddy job of it. They throw any old shite into the alloy, so their swords come out brittle and worthless. They throw helmets together without a second thought, so they fall apart when the first blow hits your head. No solid oak ever makes it into their shields - instead they hew them out of pine that arrows pierce through like butter.<br><br>Can anyone tell me why that's allowed? How a general can let his soldiers go to battle with such weapons in hand? How he expects to win a war with such weapons?<br><br>The truth is, most soldiers die during the first clash of armies, even if they're wielding a Mahakam-forged blade and clad in Nilfgaardian plate. In short, no point wasting coin on them. And those that survive either grab better kit off of corpses or requisition some from travelers.<br><br>Cruel? Perhaps. But true. So listen up, recruit: the sword they give you during training's fit at best to use as a toothpick. And the helmet - as a bedpan.

   1080375|60875858||Before we sink our teeth, so to speak, into our analysis of the katakan, the creature to whom the present work is dedicated, by way of introduction let me present to our less-experienced readers what exactly vampires are - and what they are not. To our great displeasure, a great many myths concerning these creatures have arisen over the years, and the popular tales about them have served only to make popular superstitions and falsehoods.<br><br>In the common folk's imagination, vampires are dead men and women arisen from their graves, wraiths driven by an unquenchable thirst for warm blood. Yet nothing could be further from the truth! These creatures first came to be on another world, arrived in ours centuries ago and have since learned to live among men and have evolved at our side.<br><br>The widespread belief that vampires must drink human blood in order to survive is flat-out wrong, though they do in fact often partake of our vital fluid, for human blood affects their physiology as alcohol does ours. A vampire's bite does not turn its victim into a vampire, a state of affairs which would in fact be counter to logic, for it would mean the world would soon fill with vampires as they multiply at an exponential rate. Running water presents no barrier to vampires, not even if it is cold, for vampires are immune to the forces of both heat and cold.<br><br>Now for the most important matter: vampires have learned to live in the light of our sun, which is not harmful to them in the least, though they absolutely never shimmer or glisten when struck with the sun's rays.

   1057788|612902ce||Magic is the science of harnessing, subduing and making use of the power of the elements. It is also an incarnation of Chaos, which is why no one without proper training should ever dabble in any of its domains. Expert mages make of magic an art, but the road to virtuosity leads through years of practice, study, and hard work - and requires a considerable amount of required inborn talent. Magic was implanted in our world through the Conjunction of the Spheres, and was discovered to be a living, changeable and controllable being shortly thereafter. The name of the first mage, the one who first discovered this talent within himself and grappled with its power, is unknown. We do know, however, that in a relatively short period of time after the discovery of magic groups began to form in which talented beings could work together on developing their abilities. This period is usually considered the beginning of magic as a science, and these groups – the prototypes of magic schools.<br>The fundamental planes from which one might draw magic power are: earth, water, air and fire. In the tome which you currently hold, each of these will have a separate chapter dedicated to it, ordered according to the level of difficulty and danger associated with the element discussed (…).

   1061827|6144a12a||I was at Loc Muinne - that’s right, the summit of summits itself. We’d gone there, my troupe mates and I, knowing there’d be a meeting of the mighty in the ruins. You see, whenever big shots gather to chew some particularly gristly fat, there’s coin to be had for performing men like us - tired jaws need to relax with some laughing and indulging in other sorts of simple delights. I learned this as a lad from my old man, who’d drag me around to juggle outside courts and conventions all over the Continent. And so now, plying my own trade as a fire swallower, I told the lads up soon as I caught word of what was brewing in Loc Muinne and we turned our wagons thataway at once.<br><br>I’m not much one for politics, but I couldn’t help but listen to some of it this time - you see, we Temerians had just lost our king, and our future was to be decided at that very summit, with John Natalis representing our side of the matter. Radovid was there, too, a young pup then, though emanating strength like a grey-haired alpha wolf. It seemed this wolf was licking his chops over Temeria like it was a ripe bit of carrion…<br><br>The rest was dull - a lot of talk about the uprising in Aedirn and its leader, Saskia, who they called the Virgin - though I never got the chance to check personally whether that was accurate. The Nilfgaardians had a delegate, some Shilard fellow, and mages were there, talking about restoring the Conclave and Supreme Council of Sorcerers.<br><br>I didn’t listen to much of that - my eyes were glued to the unusually large number of armed troops present at these “peaceful” talks. Steel-plated grunts clenched pointy weapons and paced the ruins’ courtyards everywhere you looked. Radovid had even brought the knightly Order of the Flaming Rose, those arrogant pricks ready to bash anyone who doesn’t think the same as them. Though the coin was coming in amply, we didn’t wait around to see how things would develop, just loaded our stuff onto our wagon and left at a trot. As we mounted the pass, we looked back to see pillars of smoke, black as pitch, rising above Loc Muinne…

Then sail to Undvik, climb the mountain and walk the ridge. Bow once to each of the four winds, commend yourself to the gods and toss the chest into the sea."<br><br>Holvarg did as the druid counseled, then returned to the Sacred Grove. "I tossed the chest in the sea," Holvarg said. "But I don't feel one bit wiser." The druid replied, "That is because there are no shortcuts on the road to wisdom. Neither saying prayers nor making offerings nor listening to the words of wisemen will grant it to you. That is your lesson.” Hearing this, Holvarg flew into a rage and strangled the druid with his bare hands, then stuck his head on a pike and set it out in front of his house, so everyone would know that, while he might not be wise, he was nobody's fool.

   1082813|62ca41a3||Yustianna was a pirate born of a Skelliger from Clan an Craite and a captive woman taken during a raid. In her time she was feared on the Continent from Ofir to Zanguebar. Known for her skill as a navigator and unmatched master of various weapons, she quickly became the terror of the Great Sea, and when she returned to Skellige, they say this cave is where she hid her loot.

   1077697|630b75e9||Dearest Sir Robert de Mere,<br><br>Thank you for sending a bill of exchange in advance, and for your understanding - if I gave out advice for free, I'd very quickly run myself out of business.<br><br>You wrote that your son went missing while on a voyage - and that near the place where he was last seen there now lurks a nekker who wears a tattered shirt with your son's monogram sewed on it. You asked if it is possible that this nekker was your son, transformed by some spell.<br><br>After consulting the relevant literature, it pains me to inform you that your hypothesis is highly improbable, and there exists a much simpler and more likely explanation. Contrary to popular belief, nekkers are a sapient species. Like forest trolls, they will at times decorate themselves with pigment or scraps of human garments. One can with some confidence surmise that this nekker killed your son, tore up his shirt, and then put on it or some fragment thereof.<br><br>While that is most likely the case, one cannot be certain. Though I have not heard of any curse capable of turning a man into a nekker, I cannot rule out the possibility of its existence. In order to find out if the above-mentioned nekker truly is a creature born of a curse, the tattered shirt it wears must be taken from it, cut into shreds and burned. The shirt's ashes can then be mixed with dimeritium dust. If the resulting substance changes color, it will confirm your hypothesis.<br><br>If the experiment I described returns a positive result, please write me. I would gladly undertake further examinations meant to find a way to lift this curse - for additional payment, of course.<br><br>Greetings,<br><br>Klaus Kellerman, <i>Magister Artibus Oxoniensis</i>

   1087432|635bc6da||Once-prospering Undvik was the second (after Ard Skellig) most-frequently visited isle in the archipelago. Among its ample charms are a prime location, picturesque scenery and a sublime local cuisine. Sadly the isle was recently devastated when some monstrous frosty giant awoke from his long slumber and began murdering and destroying whatever lay at hand.<br><br>After this occurrence many realms issued an official edict of warning cautioning their residents to avoid travel to Undvik. Nevertheless, the isle still attracts many travelers. They are no longer primarily lovers of carefree relaxation, however. Instead they are adventure seekers and mercenaries hoping to earn the bounty put on the giant's head, or, barring that, at least get a glimpse of this fantastic creature with their own eyes.<br><br>Though this is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness such a sight, we are duty-bound to advise anyone thinking of visiting Undvik to postpone their trip until conditions improve, or, even better, alter their plans and visit one of Skellige's many other attractive isles, where the risk of being disemboweled by a colossal man-beast is significantly lower.

I'd understand if you'd simply grown bored with me, I'd accept it if it had turned out that the pair we made was not to your liking or you had found yourself a younger, prettier model, but for the love of the bleeding gods - Dijkstra?! That (with all due disrespect) pot-bellied swine?! Over me?! I do not know if you have been testing new concoctions that have addled your mind or if perhaps this is another one of your games... yet even if you must seek intimacy with that primitive for political reasons, I do not see why this should mean the end of our relationship. After all, it would not be the first time we would hide our love (...)

   1078096|670f1bcc||Last week the three of us grabbed this traveler. Looked like the kind of cowardly fuck starts shitting his breeches at the first sight of you. But seems looks can be deceiving. Bastard started waving a sword, cut my ear off and sliced Olaf's arse so deep he's got an extra crack, except the new one's horizontal. Then he smacked Ivar in the forehead with the hilt. Poor sod's still dizzy.<br><br>We snuffed him in the end, of course - every fellow's doomed when he's outnumbered. But it turned out he had a handful of coins in his pouch, a copper ring on his finger - and that's it. We lost out on that robbery - paid more to the herbalist for patching up than we took from the whoreson. So afterwards Olaf said, "Why the devil risk our necks waiting around for travelers, when gold's literally sitting right under our feet - buried with the dead?" A corpse can't defend itself, so the risk of injury's nil. No need to wait around all day till someone walks by - there's already a couple dozen someone's waiting for us, lying in their graves, each one marked out like veg at a grocer's.<br><br>So I gave it a good think and concluded Olaf's talking sense. So starting tomorrow we're going to stay off the roads and do our looting in the graveyard instead.

In the days of Heribert the Quarrelsome one spoke of a particularly impoverished person as being “poorer than a mouse from Poviss,” called bone broth “Koviri delight” and referred to beggars as “praxedes,” after the bay on which these kingdoms are located.<br><br>Similarly few remember that a mere handful of generations ago Kovir and Poviss were still a part of Redania. King Radovid I, known as Radovid the Great, handed dominion over them to his hated brother, Troyden, with one stipulation - that he never leave his newly-acquired demesne and not interfere in state matters.<br><br>Handing over this rocky scrap of far northern ground (where, the saying went, the year had two seasons - August and winter) was naturally meant as a cruel joke, a slap in over-ambitious Troyden’s face.<br><br>Yet time soon proved that Radovid the Great had made a grave error. Not long afterwards it was discovered that the bare rocks of Kovir hid priceless treasure in the form of enormous deposits of precious metals and rock salt. This discovery in turn led to a tremendous growth in productive industry. Mills, forges and workshops soon sprouted up like mushrooms after a hearty rain.<br><br>Radovid III decided to correct his famous forefather’s mistake and take back control over the northern frontiers of his kingdom. He was convinced the combined armies of Redania and its then-ally, Kaedwen, would quickly bring this ever more audacious vassal in line. History took a different path, however, and Kovir won a resounding, crushing victory. Radovid III was forced to sign the First Treaty of Lan Exeter, granting Kovir independence while binding it to eternal neutrality - a promise Troyden’s successors have kept with great diligence.<br><br>Until recently Kovir was ruled by Esterad Thyssen, a king as wise as he was greedy. Yet his untimely demise did not stop his lands from continuing to develop and blossom. Koviri metallurgists proudly compete with the best Mahakam can offer, and, according to some, the University of Lan Exeter has long ago surpassed the famous Oxenfurt Academy as the seat of Northern learning. And so it has come to pass that, over the course of a few generations, the inhabitants of Kovir and Poviss have turned from paupers to princes, from beggars to bankers.

   1077568|6ad3ffa9||Folk say they were four, at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made three daughters out of dirt and water.<br><br>A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of Velen. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and acted as her voice. Every spring, sacrifices of grain, animals, and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the entire land - men began to abandon their property and set out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, Velen was drowning in blood.<br><br>The daughters saw that their land was nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came, and with it the night of sacrifices, they killed their Mother and buried her in the bog. Her blood watered the oak atop Ard Cerbin, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land and so the sisters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped under the Whispering Hillock, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.

   1071341|6e5fbe24||My Darling Rosa!<br><br>From the first moment I set eyes upon you that fateful evening at the Vegelbuds', my heart has only beaten for you. I can't eat or sleep, my master threatens to terminate my apprenticeship - and I don't even know if you remember me! Albert Vegelbud introduced us near the roasted capon table - I happened to be eating one when I saw you, it stuck in my throat and I started to choke - and you laughed, oh, how sweetly, how brightly you laughed! That marvelous sound still fills my ears to this day and I live in the hope that I will be given a chance to hear it once more. I beg you, meet with me, even if just for a moment, just for a second. I will wait by the well in Gildorf every day at dusk. If you care for the life of a poor lad fallen hopelessly in love with you, take pity and come - do not torture me with eternal waiting.<br><br>Your truly devoted admirer,<br>Ghilbert Blith

   1087435|6f94f51c||Though Spikeroog is not the most frequently-visited of the Skellige Isles, one cannot deny it has a certain inescapable charm. Particularly bewitching are the snow-capped peaks towering over its southern and western shores.<br><br>Spikeroog will surely please lovers of the martial arts. The northern portion of the isle is home to a famed arena where local warriors test their strength in no-holds-barred bouts. South of the arena lies the village of Svorlag, home to Clan Brokvar. Located on a picturesque bay, Svorlag is particularly lovely to visit in the summer and around the feasts of Belleteyn. South of Svorlag sprawls a primeval wilderness that serves as Clan Brokvar's chief hunting grounds.<br><br>Visiting the southern portions of the isle should be reserved only for extremely experienced travelers, for they are completely wild, inhospitable and deprived of all human settlements. The area is crawling with dangerous creatures of all kinds (described in more detail in the "Fauna and Flora" section). One should also show particular caution  when traveling near the caves along the isle's coast.

   1058745|70710c11||It came as a great surprise to many when, a mere three years after the Second Nilfgaardian War - the war which, it was said, “would put an end to all wars” - the empire’s forces once again invaded the North. To the perceptive student of history, however, this course of events came as no surprise - Nilfgaard’s economy and political system has for years been reliant on expansion and conquest for continued survival.<br><br>Attentive analysis shows that Nilfgaard never abandoned its plans for the subjugation of the North. Contrary to popular belief, imperial diplomats, and not sorceresses, were behind the death of King Foltest. They also brought about the crisis during the summit at Loc Muinne. The current conflict is thus the result of cold calculation and long-term planning. Before the wax even had time to dry on the Peace of Cintra, Emhyr var Emreis was already preparing for the next war, which ultimately broke out in the spring of 1270.<br><br>The first portion of the war went exactly as the emperor had planned. In a matter of mere months Lyria, Aedirn and Temeria found themselves under the shadow of the black banner. If not for the early frosts of December 1270 and the daring of Radovid - who, instead of concentrating his forces on the Pontar, invaded Kaedwen and in this way doubled his territory and strength - all the North would surely now be but another province in the vast Nilfgaardian Empire.

   1059028|72918a9f||We had a different home, once. Once we were one folk, the Aen Undod. But then came winter, death and destruction. We had to leave. The road was long and difficult. Many lost the path, others, their minds, and still others, their lives.<br><br>We came to a crossroads. One trail led to a world bursting with green, the other - to the mountainous isles the dh’oine later called Skellige. We could not agree where to go, where we would be safer, further from the White Frost. We split. Those who dwelt amidst the cliffs and rocks are called the Aen Seidhe. Those who built new homes in the land of forests are known as the Aen Elle.<br><br>We were the same, once. Now we are other. We look for each other in the stars. We speak to each other through the mouths of the Aen Saevherne. We listen to ballads about the proud Aen Elle folk. We mourn the fate of the Aen Seidhe, enslaved by the dh’oine. We remember the olden days. We await the White Frost and the next migration - or our death.

For no man knows the day or the hour, nor does any sailor know when a small dot at the edge of his vision will turn into a Nilfgaardian dromond racing towards him, its sails puffed full and its prow ready to cleave his hull like an axe.<br><br>Prevention is the first and best way to avoid such collisions: you must keep your eyes pried wide open, even when the waters are smooth as a newborn's hinterquarters and there's not a speck of land nor a hint of foreign flag to be seen. When vision fails in dark or murk, one must keep an ear cocked, especially in the waters near Skellige, for the oarsmen of the Archipelago add muster to their rowing with song and their thunderous voices carry far, so they can often be heard before they are seen. And it's a powerful boon that they thus reveal themselves, for a collision with a Skellige longship damns one doubly, for the vessel itself is armored prow to stern, while inside are ferocious, battle-hardened warriors.

A cradle erected upon Redanian soil, nurturing the greatest minds not only of that kingdom, but of all the North. To walk its hallowed Academy's halls is to embark on a journey through learning, from the finest points of Philosophy to the grandest strokes of Art, with stops made to admire Architecture and dissect Medicine along the way.<br><br>Peer to either side, and you will spy fellow travelers in your pilgrimage of learning - the students. They throng Oxenfurt's streets, lending it an indelible imprint of youth that can be felt the moment you pass through its gates. Dormitories stand cheek by jowl, booksellers hawk used tomes on every corner, and under every tree fresh faces debate poetry with passion.<br><br>Yet youth is not all slate and compass, and the young here shirk none of its other typical pastimes. Raucous and merry are the city streets, both by day and, even more so, by night. Though the city councilors have forbidden the sale of alcohol after dusk, no one seems eager to enforce this with stricture - and wisely so, for any loss of sleep is more than made up for by the gains: profits to fatten its innkeepers' pockets, and the late-night crooning of troubadours to enrich its soul.<br><br>As for its architecture, of particular note are the recently renovated elven aqueducts used to clean the city sewers. They stand as witness to the city's innovative spirit - you will not find their like in all the civilized world. Yet dominating the town's architectural visage like a glistening crown is the complex of buildings that comprises the Oxenfurt Academy. Few today remember that these edifices, constructed by the elves, predate the city itself - it is the institution that named the city, and not vice-versa.<br><br>Today Oxenfurt Academy enjoys a reputation matched only by the Imperial Academy in Nilfgaard. Of greatest renown - the departments of Alchemy, Natural History, Minstrelsy and Poetry, Medicine and Herbology, Engineering and, last but certainly not least, Philosophy.

I refused.<br><br>13th of Blathe, 5th day of excavations<br>We pitched camp in a vast and dry cavern in the easterly portion of the complex. There are a few active portals here. I am afraid they are very likely unstable and unidirectional.<br><br>14th of Blathe, 6th day of excavations<br>The witcher murdered Marco! He was deciphering one of the priceless elven sketches when suddenly, as I watched on aghast, the witcher slit his throat and grabbed his incunabulum! I panicked and jumped into one of the portals. It deposited me in some chamber which has no exit. Unless an echo of the portal appears, I am stuck here for good. I hope Michelle and Gottfried managed to escape.<br><br>[remainder of the notes difficult to decipher and no dates are indicated]<br><br>I must conclude the witcher had from the very start been operating on Prince Adrien's orders. I would not be surprised if they were toasting their scheme's success Drahim Castle at this very moment. Blast it, perhaps I should have given those elven diagrams to Kiyan after all? What good are they to me here, if I am to rot in this crypt?<br><br>I have finished the last drops of my water. There is nothing to eat. No echo from the portal has appeared.<br><br>Gods...

   1057782|759bd493||Skellige the political entity encompasses the archipelago of the same name, composed of twenty individual isles. The largest of them are Ard Skellig, An Skellig, Undvik, Faroe, Spikeroog and Hindarsfjall. Originally these isles were inhabited by independent clans, but these later united to face the growing threat from barbarians as well as the rising powers of the Continent. Skellige then became an elective monarchy, ruled by a king chosen from among the jarls (clan chieftains). The present leader of the Skelligers is Bran of Clan Tuirseach.<br><br>It is worth noting that, in contrast to the situation in the kingdoms on the Continent, in Skellige each inhabitant is a citizen and enjoys equal rights, regardless of birth, trade or the property they possess.<br><br>On account of the rocky and often barren terrain and inhospitable climate, the inhabitants of Skellige gain their sustenance primarily from fishing, maritime trade and armed raiding. Though this last is primarily the work of men, female warriors are not unheard of, and they equal their fathers and brothers in courage and skill. For Skelligers believe that each is master of his or her own fate, and when Freya determines a man's or woman’s destiny, she looks only to inner predispositions, and cares not for outward traits of status or sex.

I congratulate you - and at the same time inform you that you will never have the pleasure of meeting me again.<br><br>I long deluded myself into thinking I could wake the citizens of Novigrad from their slumber, make them aware of their corruption and point them on the right path - that which leads to the Eternal Fire and the cleansing it provides.<br><br>Yet even though - as you well know - I stopped at nothing in my efforts, it appears they will not bring about the desired results. Novigrad's moral pox has spread too far and too deep - it is now incurable and fatal. Though many consider me a fanatic, even I realize further shock therapy of the kind I have been administering will do no good.<br><br>I will thus depart for another, smaller settlement, where the process of moral decay has just begun and where my intervention may yet stand a chance of stopping it.

   1080719|760a065d||While the Emperor of Nilfgaard wields absolute power and harshly punishes the slightest sign of disobedience, opposing forces continue to exist within the Empire. By this I do not have in mind the disgruntled leaders of conquered provinces, but the magnates within the City of a Thousand Towers who are unhappy with their current leadership. This conflict between the Emperor and the aristocratic houses of the Nilfgaardian capital dates back many years. All the princes of the blood and the magnates expected the ruler to wed one of their daughters, to sire an heir with one of their own. The Emperor, however, had other plans. This was a slap in the face for the great families from which he refused to choose a bride.<br><br>The Nilfgaardian opposition patiently waits for the Emperor to slip up, for some event to occur which will weaken his authority, be it an economic crisis or a defeat in battle. A secret conspiracy lies ready to seize such a moment to incite the disaffected, assassinate the Emperor and carry out a coup d'état whose culmination will place one of their number on the throne.<br><br>For obvious reasons, only a limited few know about this conspiracy, but any shrewd observer of Nilfgaardian politics can read the signs of its workings. So long as men are men and the world is as it is, certain dynamics will never change, and the discontented will always form subversive societies replete with secret signs and hidden agendas.

   1062856|76901f8c||Kiyan performed wonderfully! It's a shame, of course, that Professor Gloger disappeared somewhere in the ruins of Est Tayiar along with the rest of the elven diagrams, but those sketches for a steel sword alone are worth as much as a village in southern Redania!<br><br>We split the takings equally, as per our agreement: I kept the diagram for the silver sword, while Kiyan took the crossbow diagram. I must admit, I didn’t exactly need every member of the expedition’s head preserved in vinegar, but they do constitute impressive proof of Kiyan's conscientiousness and professionalism. The witcher swore none of the archaeologists would leave Est Tayiar alive - and none did.<br><br>All the more shame, then, that Kiyan didn’t accept my offer. As my personal bodyguard, he would never have wanted for a thing. Steady pay, caviar and strawberries for breakfast, lobster for lunch, daily baths, a court surgeon and courtesans of both sexes for all his needs… and if he still lacked for anything, he had but to knock on my chamber door.<br><br>He must very much love all that trudging around the world, because I do not believe Jacob of Dembich could have dangled a better offer than I did! Really now - Jacob of Dembich?! A second-rate captain transporting whores to dockside Novigrad pimps for a fistful of crowns?

   1076472|7888d694||A soldier can wear a dirty jerkin, rank footcloths and stained greaves. A soldier can walk around unshaven, can stink to high heaven or even have the mange. But his sword must always shine as if straight from the forge! For in a battle neat clothing and an eye-pleasing appearance will not save anyone's life, but a sword will, as long as its well-cared for and the man at the dull end knows what he's doing.<br><br>So how should you care for your blade? Simple. After every battle, wipe all the blood and guts off of it, take an oil-soaked linen rag and give it a good rub down. If you're fighting in swamplands or in heavy rain, it's worth your while to coat the blade in beeswax. You should sharpen its edges regularly, using a good whetstone. It's important to take your time in doing this - each movement should be steady and delicate, like you're stroking a virgin on your first night together.<br><br>If your sword develops rust, it means you're slovenly and lazy oaf. Take some sand in your hand at once and scour the blade till the stains disappear. Take heed, though, not to cut your fingers in the doing, for then you won't be any good to anyone.

As usual, I must do everything myself.<br><br>I will administer a brew of medicinal opium to the subject. This “milk of the poppy” will keep the witcher in a state of half-consciousness, and thus incapable of any resistance. Commencing studies.<br><br>Note: I must hold off on my planned experiments while I clear up the demolished portion of my laboratory. I have set the bones in the forearm of one of my assistants. I will now administer a quadruple does of “milk of the poppy” to the witcher.<br><br>Day 4.<br>Subject shows incredible resistance to physical torture. Only broke after the second day of intense labor. Moderately satisfactory results from the interrogation. Garnered information about witcher training and the Cat School of witchers in general. As I suspected, the Cat School witchers are for the most part of elven stock. This school must have some tie to the Elder Races (addendum: perhaps its founder was a member of the Aen Seidhe?<br><br>Subject unfit for further study. I have discontinued his doses of poppy.<br><br>Day 7.<br>Administered extract of cowbane and hemlock. In typical representatives of the human and Aen Seidhe species such a mixture provokes paralysis of the peripheral nervous system, and eventually of the nerve endings as well. This results in muscular, skeletal, pulmonary and cardiac paralysis, and ultimately death through suffocation.<br><br>The witcher is not, however, a typical representative of any species. Though the poison did seem to cause some mild irritation (sic!) in his nervous system, his mutated body quickly managed to neutralize the harmful alkaloids.<br><br>In a matter of hours all symptoms of the poison I administered have vanished.<br><br>Day 15.<br>Stinging him with sea wasp toxin did not provoke the expected results. In order to strengthen the toxin’s effect I have poured ethyl alcohol into his wounds. His nervous system seems to be immune.<br><br>Day 26.<br>The subject has been tortured, poisoned, burnt, frozen, starved and dehydrated, and despite it all his body continues to function. He eats and drinks by himself, moves about his cell on his own and is able to articulate simple words (“please”, “drink”, “don’t hurt”, “stop”).<br><br>Conclusion: as I suspected the witcher is a superb energumen! A demon trapped in such an excellently prepared body will become death incarnate, vengeful wrath made flesh – and placed at my command. No one has succeeded in creating a being of such power since the times of Malaspin and Alzur.<br><br>This is a great day for science!<br><br>Time to begin the incantations.

   1046779|7a8c6c02||To my dear friends, Phillip and Anna - from Count la Guevre, Minister of Culture for the Kingdom of Temeria.<br>Vizima, 1265<br><br>Whoever thinks curses are only ever manifestations of one being's ill will towards another is sorely mistaken. Shockingly commonplace are reports of curses cast unwittingly on oneself or on objects in one's immediate environment. The consequences of doing so can be difficult to predict. In many cases they lead to harm or even the death of the person afflicted by the curse, or of the people spending time with the object or being on which the curse fell. That is why it is so essential to take preventative measures to safeguard oneself as thoroughly as possible against the casting of curses. As an absolute minimum Madame Amelia Veracruz-Leon recommends: cleansing oneself of all negative thoughts, striving to be at one with the world and achieving harmony between body and mind.

Yet they are noble beasts, endowed with great intelligence and displaying a strength and independence that no man can help but admire.

It didn't all go exactly like I'd imagined as a little girl, but, well, you always taught me to make the most of what I've got. We're traveling now, so I'll send this letter as soon as we arrive.<br><br>I'll start with what I'm sure interests you the most - financial matters. As I'm sure you've noticed, a few crowns have gone missing from your lockbox, the cupboard's a couple silver plates lighter, and your jewelry box isn't near as full as it once was. I took it. As my dowry. No doubt much less than you'd have given, had I but found myself a "worthy partner," but, tough, that's life.<br><br>Kurt – or, as you like to call him, "that good-for-nothing bare-arsed lazybones" - is now my husband. And your daughter's precious purity, which you cared about more than her feelings, tears or pleadings - well, it's only a memory now.<br><br>We'll soon arrive at our destination. Naturally, I won't tell you where exactly that is - just in case you get it in your head to come visit. Wherever it is, know your silver will be enough to set up a nice home. That's important - because I'm expecting a child. Are you glad? I doubt it. You always said poor matches only produce mutts and scoundrels. So it's a good thing you'll never have to see this one.<br><br>Your little girl,<br><br>-Jeanette

Dried twigs covered the sheet - that was the first proof, for werewolves return at dawn after a night of hunting, their bare feet covered in the forest's droppings. They found the second proof under his bed: a wolf's hide. The werewolf surely dressed himself in it when transforming with the setting sun, and shed it again when he turned to man the next day. Having found these powerful proofs they ceased deliberation and began the hunt, vowing to find the lycanthrope and bind him in silver chains.

   1085663|7dc179bb||Last night a soldier fled from the Army Camp under cover of darkness. The wanted man, a recruit who recently volunteered to join His Imperial Majesty's service, goes by the name of Odrin. He claimed to be a Kaedweni by birth, but said King Henselt's misrule had convinced him to join the Imperial Army. He was part of said institution for a mere two days, but managed to eat and drink enough in that time for an entire regiment of dragoons. Anyone with information about this deserter's present location is to report to the garrison at once.<br><br>Description: Modest stature, wiry, with thinning hair. He fled in his undergarments by squeezing out through the latrines' drainage system and probably thus reeks like an old boar. Characteristic marks: can be easily recognized by his voice, which has the tell-tale rasp of a hardened alcoholic. Anyone found providing shelter or sustenance to this deserter will be subjected to a summary court-martial.

   1057914|7de14085||From farmers and herdsmen, milkmaids to midwives - all the common folk of the Continent whisper, sharing tales of a wraithly procession pounding across the sky. The Wild Hunt, they call it. Winds and gales, storms and blizzards arise when it is sighted, and all grows cold, though the sun shone bright moments before. Some remember only the cold from the shock of the encounter, and claim the Riders come always in winter. But nay, this is not so - the Hunt brings its own ice.<br><br>Death and war gallop in its wake, or so the superstition goes. Yet evil enough is the Hunt itself. It takes folk captive, youths, most often, in the prime of their wilding years, with ten to twenty summers behind them. The Hunt rushes in and they disappear, only to return long years later with no memory of what passed in the time between. (...)

They are instead a family forged by warriors who have heard the "call of the bear" and answered it by abandoning their loved ones and joining the community of mountain dwellers.<br><br>Not every man who seeks to join it is accepted into the brotherhood: the candidates must first pass difficult trials which usually end in their death. The last trial is the hardest. It is called the "Trial of the Bear's Triumph," but few outside the brotherhood have ever witnessed it and none know what those who undergo it must endure.<br><br>Quite curiously, the inhabitants of Skellige themselves know very little about the berserkers, or "vildkaarls," as they call them. They do not like to talk about these man-bears, not with outsiders and not even amongst themselves.

   1061808|7fef2684||War with Nilfgaard first broke out in 1263. The immediate cause of conflict - a clear act aggression on the part of Nilfgaard against Cintra. The Imperial Army crossed the Amell Mountains and attacked Cintra's southern border stations, near the forest known as Erlenwald. Unverified rumors claim some special attachment between Emhyr var Emreis and this place - the import of this, however, is unknown. What is certain is that he long ago staked an unfounded claim to control over all of Cintra.<br><br>The deciding battle took place in the Marnadal Valley. There Nilfgaard surrounded and decimated Cintra’s forces. King Eist Tuirseach fell in the battle. The survivors, led by Queen Calanthe, sought shelter in the capital, yet none was there to be found - the city was massacred, and Queen Calanthe took her own life in despair.<br><br>Next the theater of war shifted to the Upper Sodden area, where acts of terror and barbarous cruelty took place. Historical consensus holds that the bestial acts the Imperial Army committed here propelled the North to victory in the so-called Second Battle of Sodden. The atrocities had left the Northern Armies with only two options: win the war, or die along with their families. Desperate determination thus drove them to defeat the seemingly-undefeatable Nilfgaardian Army. The next year, 1264, an armistice was signed which ceded control over Cintra to the Empire, making it the northernmost province of Nilfgaard in all but name.

People will believe the most outlandish nonsense.<br><br>Valeria has decided to move back in with her mother for some time. Until I do something about the walls. I joked that perhaps I could simply repaint them, but I don’t think she found that amusing.<br><br>The plaster has begun to fall off. It seems to me that I heard a noise last night, something like a muffled roar.<br><br>Valeria has returned. She found a buyer for the home. Avoided any suspicion by claiming to be the mage's widow, selling off the estate after her husband's unfortunate death at the stake. Fool count must think he has found himself an incredible bargain.

   1058761|836690cb||Sad as it is, to many in our time the word "elf" is a synonym for pauper, bandit or layabout. "She-elf" is used in many circles to denote a prostitute or woman of loose morals. The adjective "elven," in turn, describes damaged, needlessly complicated or useless goods. Statistics, for their part, show that one in three elves living in Redanian has spent time in prison, and a full one half of them have been fined at least once. The average lifespan of elves, though still thrice that of humans, grows shorter each year.<br><br>Given the above it is easy to forget that elves - or Aen Seidhe, as they fashion themselves - were once a proud race that ruled the lands stretching from the banks of the Great Sea in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and from the Dragon Mountains in the North to the Mahakam range in the south. The ruins of their cities scattered throughout the known world bear witness to their former might (cp. “Monumenta Elforum” by Istredd of Aedd Gynvael).<br>Many of the most outstanding mages, artists and poets of recorded history have been of this race. And we have elves to thank for dozens of ingenuous items we rely on each day, from screw pumps to cosmetics.<br>Those elves who dwell amongst men have largely forgotten their history and culture - the sole sliver of elven identity left in them being a burning hatred for men, the so-called<i>dh’oine</i>. The elves of Dol Blathanna, that puppet vassal of Nilfgaard, and of the wild highlands of the Blue Mountains have retained much of the old knowledge and culture, though they, too, are condemned to perish. This death sentence was handed to them by biology - for men, though short-lived, are several times more fertile than elves. Thus, while the Aen Seidhe's numbers continue to dwindle, ours grow at an alarming and ever-increasing rate.<br>Some elves believe that the tide of events can be turned, that they can put a stop to human exapnsion and oppression. They look to their mythical cousins for salvation - to the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk. The Aen Elle are said to dwell in another world or possibly in another plane to which they traveled during the mythic Age of Migration, and from which they at times journey to visit our world. Legend claims a gate between the worlds could be opened, allowing the Aen Elle to ride to their downtrodden brethren's rescue. These are, however, mere fables, naïve fairy tales this race condemned to extinction uses to provide itself small comfort in these, their last, sad moments.

   1061823|862df541||Temeria… a land where milk and honey once flowed. In what did she wrong the Gods, for them to treat her so cruelly? The Pearl of the North, to some, and a galloping range for Nilfgaardian cavalry to others. A country that withstood two wars against the empire. It was here their bloodiest battles took place. It was in Temeria where their most bestial deeds were wrought. It was the Temerian civilian population that had to bear the full brunt of the war’s horrors.<br><br>And bear it we did, bravely and steadfastly, until the death of our great protector - King Foltest. Then providence turned its fickle face from Temeria. Murdered most treacherously, Foltest did not leave Temeria a worthy successor.<br><br>And so all manner of cur soon fell on her, tearing her apart like so much carrion. She had no more allies, then. None remembered that we had once been the armor protecting the North from the designs of the mad Dancer, he who had the gravestones of his enemies pounded into a ballroom floor.<br><br>Now there is no more free and independent Temeria. A dark-faced sun looms over her every rampart. Yet there are still Temerians. And there always will be. As long as people still believe, the usurper who took our beloved capital, Vizima, and treated it as his own property will always have to peer over his shoulder in fear. For in the shadows lurks not one dagger, but the power of a nation of daggers, waiting to deal justice’s blow.
   1058781|86370749||<i>To my beloved Y. I still await your kestrel.</i><br>Istredd of Aedd Gynvael<br><br>Let us begin, dear reader, with a riddle. What links a town like Vizima, the proud capital of Temeria, or Oxenfurt, a center of learning for all the North, with Aedd Gynvael, a provincial settlement at the end of the known world? Nothing, it would seem… After all, each of these places looks, sounds and even smells different. Their origins, however, are identical – all were founded atop ancient elven cities. The ruins sprawling beneath their streets bear witnesss to this fact.<br>A tour of elven monuments is best begun in Vizima - in the city sewers, to be precise. A dangerous place, to be sure, so it is worth bringing along a well-armed guide. A branch of the sewers leads to the remains of an Aen Seidhe city. One can still admire its masterfully carved plafonds, peer into its immaculately polished marble facings, find artifacts discarded by the Elder Race and hold ancient tomes that disintegrate in one’s hands. Equally impressive monuments of elven culture can be found only in Oxenfurt – as well as somewhere in the wilds of Velen, though I have been unable to verify this information personally.<br>What caused elven civilization to collapse? Plague? Cataclysm? No, dear reader. Their destruction was caused by us, by humans. We drove the elves from their cities and, instead of occupying their marvelous palaces, we dismantled them to build our meager and crooked huts. All that remains is that which we covered in debris and sludge, and then wiped from our memories for centuries.

   1083225|87c3832f||To think that man appeared on an empty world and gained mastery over it unchallenged is as foolish as thinking the world will cease to exist after man's passing. Before the first human set foot on our world, it was inhabited by beings superior to men in terms of wisdom, strength and every other virtue.<br><br>The beings I have in mind still exist in our present time, though they do not exist in a sphere available to human understanding. They occupy no dimension known to us - where they live can best be described as a space between worlds.<br><br> At times one can sense their presence through a sudden, unknown scent or a strange feeling of anxiety with no apparent cause. A wind which blows in several directions at once is another example of their subtle manifestation in our realm. There exist various imaginings of what these creatures might look like, yet these have nothing to do with reality, for man is incapable of conceiving something which he has not seen, even in his wildest nightmares.<br><br>The greatest horror these beings bring comes precisely from their indefiniteness and lack of concrete form. Yet it would be a mistake to think that a formless creature is necessarily harmless. The power they possess is sufficient to lay waste to a forest, level a city or whip an entire sea into froth and waves. Today man is master of the world, but only for a short while. They await patiently and will soon arise and regain their one-time glory. This is as certain as dawn follows dusk, and dusk then follows again soon after, to drown everything once more in darkness.

   1055858|88efaa7d||Each beast herein described in two manners ye may hunt. Either seek ye tracks, follow and strike the foulness wherever in its wild ye find it, or lure it to a chosen place and engage it there in advantageous battle. The latter poses less risk, for the hunter exposes no chance for an unexpected fight. Note, however, that to lure a beast into a trap, first its tastes and behaviors ye must know. As for forktails, bait them thusly: pound a stake in the soil, bind a goat to it, then hide ye in nearto shrubbery posthaste. The beast, lured by the caprine odor, will without fail soon come. If it is a griffin ye seek to slay, take ye buckthorn from deep water. The mighty stench of this herb is to griffins like fresh-roasted meat of the primest sort, and so come they will forthwith, though faraway they might be. Turning to drowners and water hags, it is known to all and sundry that fish and rotting mollusks are their loves, and as for trolls, common hooch is their weakness.

If previously anyone believed the ongoing war did not concern the Free City, now not a single resident doubts the course of the conflict will be determined within its walls. Our agents have confirmed earlier reports stating King Radovid has important plans for Novigrad, and lately we have observed an increase in his agents' activity and the spread of his propaganda. His prime objective seems to be the seizure of the wealth held by the Church of the Eternal Fire. Yet though Hierarch Hemmelfart officially rules the city, true power is in the hands of local crime bosses. I recommend the emperor's agents focus further activity in that direction.<br><br>Henry var Attre<br><br>by decree of His Imperial Highness<br><br>Ambassador of the Nilfgaardian Empire in the Free City of Novigrad

   1061792|8a55e082||Responsibility for the outbreak of the first war (1263-1264) lies wholly with the Temerian special forces. Intercepted documents clearly show that Temeria was acting towards the annexation of Cintra, a brazen blow to the balance of power that the Empire could not allow. Only by moving its forces into Cintra and establishing order there could the empire reverse the Temerians’ destructive actions and safeguard the peace. Sadly, the North, stubborn and short-sighted as ever, chose armed conflict over reasonable compromise.<br><br>During this conflict Northern forces perpetrated unpardonable atrocities, for which reprisals came first with the Battle of Marnadal Valley and then in the Cintra incident. Our Imperial Highness, Emhyr var Emreis, expressed his sympathies in a letter to the Cintrian court and hoped such horrors would never need be repeated.<br><br>Once Cintra was taken, the Nilfgaardian forces considered the Northern situation stabilized, yet the North fought on, leading to the clash near Sodden. Nordling propaganda depicts this battle as the turning point of the war, but in truth it had no political significance whatsoever. Shortly afterwards an armistice was signed, as a result of which Cintra became a vassal of the Nilfgaardian Empire for time and all eternity.

   1077292|8bfa3978||Talaith and the Evil Witch<br><br>No one in all of Tir ná Lia knew how to help Talaith remove the evil spell cast upon her brother. Overwhelming despair clouded her judgment and she went to see an old witch. She forgot the Sages' warning that the old woman's heart was black as pitch and foul as carrion crawling with maggots.<br>The old witch lived in a cage in the wastes surrounded by poisonous vapors and venomous vipers and toads. Talaith went there, even though her pure heart cried out for her to turn back. As she approached the cave, she smelled an odor so terrible she almost fainted. She had no idea what it was - for she had never been near a human before. She overcame her disgust, thinking all the while about her brave brother, and asked the witch for help.<br>"And what will you give me in return, my dear elf?" screeched the witch.<br>"Anything you ask."<br>"Give me your voice, my dear elf, and I'll lift Leod's curse."<br>Talaith thought about how she used to sing lullabies to her little brother and began to cry, but she gave the witch her beautiful voice all the same. The old woman grabbed it in her crooked talons like a small silver fish and tossed it to her cat.<br>"Now give me your hair, my dear elf! Only then will I lift your brother's curse."<br>Talaith sobbed, but agreed, and the witch wove a thick net from her hair and hung it from the trees in order to catch birds.<br>"Now give me your eyes, my dear elf, or I'll never lift Leod's curse."<br>Talaith loved her brother very much and so gave the witch her green eyes, and the witch sewed them onto her dirty dress like precious stones for ornament. And she started to laugh. Only then did Talaith understand that the witch would never lift Leod's curse and all her sacrifices had been for nothing. But she could no longer cry. Oh, how she regretted not having listened to the Sages, who tell so many tales of human treachery!<br>Talaith was petrified with regret, but her pure heart continued beating. When the old woman bent over her book of spells, Talaith's green eyes read along with her and in this way Talaith learned it was the witch who had put the curse on her brother Leod. She read along with the witch further until she learned how to lift curse. And so she caught fat robins with the net the witch had woven from her hair and fed them to the witch's cat. Purring with delight, the cat agreed to follow her back to Tir ná Lia. There it told the Sages the whole story about Talaith's stolen voice, and they recognized that it was true.<br>The evil spells cast on Leod and Talaith were reversed, and the evil witch was drawn and quartered.

He tried countless ways to tame her, but no matter what lengths he went to, he could not get along with her. Finally he sailed to Hindarsfjall to meditate in Hindar, the sacred grove. Hemdall and Freya took pity on him and gave him the formula for a potion that would grant him Understanding. They also instructed him to take a new approach, do something he had never done before, to resolve his conflicts with his wife. In order to gather the required ingredients, Sove had to kill a monster, climb the highest mountain in the isles and dive into the deepest undersea chasm. Then he prepared the potion, quaffed it and, searching for another approach to the conflict, began meditating while hanging from the tree<i>Irminsul</i>by one leg. In this manner he achieved enlightenment, and returned to Spikeroog to live with Ulula in peace and harmony to the end of their days.

   1061814|8de4bdcb||Unlike the First Nilfgaard War, the second conflict had no clear aggressor. In early 1267 the Northern kings met in Hagge and prepared a plan for the reconquest of Cintra. Foreseeing their intentions, Emperor var Emreis amassed a large expeditionary force on the Temerian border. He then masterminded a series of events that left the North ripe for an attack - a mages' revolt erupted on Thanedd, and King Vizimir was assassinated, leaving Redania in chaos. All Emhyr needed now was a pretext, which he received when soldiers supposedly from Aedirn attacked the Nilfgaardian frontier fortress known as Glevitzingen. Armed with that excuse, the Nilfgaardian forces marched north and the second war had begun.<br><br>During the first phase of the war, the imperial offensive quickly swept through the North. First they occupied southern Lyria. After a short siege, Rivia was next to fall. Next came the Battle of Aldersberg, and then Menno Coehoorn's march into Vengerberg. King Henselt of Kaedwen seized this opportunity to dismember his neighbor and signed an agreement with Nilfgaard partitioning Aedirn between them. Opportunistic elves also joined the Empire's cause and gained for their trouble an independent kingdom in Dol Blathanna. King Foltest was the next rat out of the sinking ship, signing a treaty with Nilfgaard and grabbing for himself the western portion of Aedirn. Deserted by his allies and left with a rump of a kingdom, Demavend, ruler of Aedirn, fled to seek shelter in Redania.<br><br>The first stage of the war ended and the second began when Nilfgaard broke its truce with Temeria after a mere sixteen days. Its forces then immediately invaded Brugge and Sodden, and soon both lands were awash in blood. In short order Emhyr had occupied all of southern Temeria and shattered Foltest’s troops at Maribor. Then the shrewd emperor retreated back to winter in Sodden and prepare a renewed offensive for the spring.<br><br>No war in history saw such fierce battles as the Great Temerian Offensive waged during those fair spring days. The united forces of the North at last proved themselves a worthy opponent and slowed the Nilfgaardian advance. This provided an opening for Emhyr's internal enemies to put in motion a plot for his overthrow. Weakened by this infighting (known as the Conspiracy of Nobles), the myth of its invincibility shattered, Nilfgaard’s mightiest army was then routed by Northern forces near Brenna. The tide of war had turned.<br><br>The fourth and final phase of the war then began. The North opened a counter-offensive forcing the Imperial Armies into a slow and bloody retreat. It was only a matter of time before armistice talks were opened, temporary cease-fire lines were drawn and the war drew to a close. Delegates from all parties to the conflict decided to convene in Cintra to draw up a peace treaty and establish a new world order. On the 2nd of April, 1268, the Peace of Cintra was signed, bringing an end to the Second Nilfgaard War.

   1069038|8e16761f||Chapter 1.<br><br>More than curds!<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, tyromancy does not only consist of cutting cheese and examining the result. Adherents of this ancient but now forgotten and unfairly disregarded branch of the divining arts know that the slice and peek, as we call it, is only the beginning.<br><br>Once a student has mastered the fundamentals of first degree tyromancy, he should be encouraged to better his olfactory capabilities, with the aid of magic, if needs be. Once he has made satisfactory progress in this regard, he should be confronted with a well-aged and thoroughly-ripe blue cheese, preferably in an enclosed space. The first days of this training might prove stormy. Discipline is especially vital at this stage - by no means should you respond to the student’s pleas and open the larder doors.<br><br>Chapter 2.<br><br>On the superiority of tyromancy<br><br>Though tyromancy’s advantages vis a vis the other forms of divining are self-evident to me, I have gone to the trouble of a thorough comparison of its results and can with great certitude say that cheese-induced visions are much more reliable than, say, those brought about by chiromancy, aleuromancy or the current craze, rumpology (those interested in that may refer to "Rumpology – the Art of Divining from Buttocks. With Illustrations!" by Artorius Viggo).

   1076204|9425bfc3||Day 237<br><br>My experiments continue to return results I must consider unreliable. Methodological errors are not at fault. The problem lies in the shoddy and fallible research material I am forced to work with. Despite his prior assurance, Vserad is unable to provide me with enough moderately healthy specimens for my tests. Most of the material is starved and terrified, having been dragged here straight from the dungeon. I waste a great deal of time daily washing and delousing them before I will so much as let them step foot into my laboratory. Sterility first.<br><br>As Marti Sodergren managed to prove in her little-known work, the attitude of a patient undergoing treatment can have a significant impact on the battle against the disease. Unfortunately the volunteers with which I am supplied do not show sufficient comprehension - let alone enthusiasm - for the noble work in which they are taking part. In fact, it seems they consider the research part of their punishment. I have tried a few times (though I am but a poor speaker) to convince them that they are contributing to the eradication of one of the greatest plagues tormenting mankind. I had the distinct impression they understood little, but perhaps their stupor was merely the result of the early stages of the illness.<br><br>Of course, it is impossible to achieve success without significant sacrifices. The overwhelming majority of them will have to lay down their trifling lives on the altar of learning. But that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

   1076251|95da9862||Day 346<br><br>I never did like rats. Not because of their obscene tails, but rather on account of their lively, disturbing intelligence. They are always listening when a man believes he is talking only to himself. And, what's worse, they seem to understand.<br><br>A few days ago, I caught myself talking to one of them - to a particularly large, black male with a torn-off ear. At first I was overcome by panic. Was this a first manifestation of the illness? Of course, that was impossible, for I had fortified my immunity with powerful spells. Upon further consideration, I concluded it was an altogether natural reflex, one even the most learned among us find hard to restrain. We mages like to be listened to.<br><br>I placed the black rat in a separate cage. The time will come for it to play a part in the tests. Meanwhile, it can "keep me company." And observe. I've noticed it looks with great concentration at the cages of its infected brethren, particularly those in the last stages of illness. Fascinating.<br><br>Speaking of company - I have none, besides the black rat, and cannot hope for better. Vserad avoids the laboratory and has expressed his desire for his daughter to steer clear of me as well. At first I thought he feared a moral scandal - which would be risible in the extreme - but he explained the true reason in due course. It seems Anabelle has always possessed a fragile psychic constitution. Observing the ill might throw her into foul humors.<br><br>The peasants taking part in the study have stopped speaking to me. I don't know what they believe this little act of defiance will serve. It does me no harm - they made for lousy conversation partners. There remains, of course, The Woman, but as for her, I try to limit my contact.<br><br>Day 362<br><br>My black rat has died - today I found him curled up in his cage. I suspected he had become infected on accident, but during the autopsy I did not uncover any signs of illness. He was also perfectly well-fed. Strange. From a medical point of view his death remains unexplained, something which, I must admit, irritates the scholar in me. But, as mentioned previously, I'm not particularly fond of rats.

Amos var Ypsis' tome confirms what I have long suspected - that, despite my failure to do so previously, taming a djinn is, in fact, possible.<br><br>According to var Ypsis, the difficulties involved in bending such a being to one's will can be overcome. He managed to do so, at the least.<br><br>Alas, this does not mean his methods will necessarily be useful to me - each djinn is different, each case requires a singular approach. I've more experience unraveling such magic riddles than almost anyone else alive, and if Geralt, with his talent for wrestling unruly magic beings, agrees to help, we just might find a way to do it. The problem is we must first find a djinn, a daunting task unto itself…

   1061789|99d66d40||<i>Childhood and Early Manhood</i><br><br>Though the Nilfgaardian throne was his by right of birth, it would be many long years before Emhyr var Emreis sat upon it. When he was thirteen, an uprising broke out in the empire’s capital. Emhyr’s father was overthrown and a usurper seized power in his stead. Emhyr's father, Fergus var Emreis, refused to grant legitimacy to this coup, and so the usurper tried to break him by having mages torture Emhyr, his son and heir. This plan failed - the usurper was forced to kill Fergus and Emhyr escaped, presumably to somewhere outside the Empire's territory.<br><br>No reliable accounts of the emperor's actions during his time of exile and wandering exist. Some claim he fell into the company of a knight errant, acting as his squire. This seems plausible enough, though the tales about this eccentric knight's proclivity to charge windmills are surely storytellers' exaggerations. A few unreliable reports claim a connection between Emhyr and the fabled Urcheon of Erlenwald who saved the life of King Roegner of Cintra. This seems far less likely, for it is public record that when the witcher Geralt of Rivia lifted the Urcheon's curse, he was revealed to be a prince named Duny, who later wed King Roegner's granddaughter, Pavetta, and died at her side during a tragic shipwreck.<br><br>What is known for certain is that around this time of great tragedy for the kingdom of Cintra Emhyr reappeared within the Empire and led a rebellion which overthrew the usurper and restored him his birthright. Soon afterwards he led the Empire's armies in their successful conquest of Cintra, setting a tone of determined military expansion that would last throughout the rest of his reign.

   1076499|9b544c6f||What splendid diversity reigns in the kingdom of cheese! The ripened curd can be white or blue, hard or soft, fresh or aged, from the milk of cows, sheep or goats, brined, pickled or untouched... This list could go on till the end of time! And each of them, every last slice, every morsel and crumb, not only brings with it an unmatched rush of sensory experience, but in the right hands can be made to reveal the universe's most closely-guarded secrets.<br><br>For cheese, like the innards of sacrificed animals, the flight of a swallow or vivid dreams, can be used for divination. The depth and size of a cheese's holes reveal when rains will fall in the coming year, while the color of mold veins tells who shall love whom, and the scent of a hard grana padano predicts which army will vanquish its foes and which shall perish.<br><br>The best divination, however, is done using the ancient method of fondue. One must simply melt two different kinds of cheese, preferably emmental and gruyere, in white wine or, in a pinch, in a dry apple cider. Then one must use a long stick to immerse a morsel of bread in the resultant thick soupy mixture, all the while keeping in mind the question, "What shall my child be like when he (or she, as the case may be) grows?" Then bring the cheese-covered morsel of bread up to a candle, so that it casts a shadow on the wall: the shape will provide a sure and easily understood answer to your query.

   1058773|9ca063c2||As a mule is neither ass nor horse though it has traits of both, so are witchers neither mages nor common men.<br><br>Witchers are able to cast simple spells they call Signs, drawing on the basics of telekinesis (Aard), pyrokinesis (Igni), hypnosis (Axii) and so on. They are not, however, capable of utilizing more complex spells - indeed, they treat real magic with reserve and distrust. Widespread in their ranks is an irrational, nigh onto superstitious fear of teleportation (let me remind you that deadly accidents during translocational travel occur only once per one hundred instances of such travel!).<br><br>This aversion surely stems from the fact that witchers do not possess inborn magic talents, but instead gain them during their infamous Trial of the Grasses. It can thus be said that their casting spells is an affront to nature - as is, in fact, everything witchers do.

Alas, such was Muriel's great misfortune that these bandits chose to attack her carriage.<br><br>Muriel's nursemaid was old, blind and deaf. She did not wake when a tree fell in front of their carriage with a loud thud, nor when the bandits fought a fierce battle against their guardsmen. When Flynn ripped open the carriage door with his muscular arms and stepped inside, Muriel had to deal with the danger herself. "Make our guest comfortable, young lady," the old nursemaid muttered in her sleep. Muriel obediently carried out her instructions.

   1061984|9ee17bbd||Three things are required for human life to be sustained - food, drink, and gossip. It is thus no wonder that no matter where I travel, be it ice-bound Poviss or ever green Toussaint, everyone asks me about the passions that bind Geralt and the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. As a man both cautious and discreet in nature, I refuse to betray their secrets - with one important exception. The history of their first encounter is so extraordinary, so romantic and moving, that it would be a veritable crime to hide its light under a bushel. Indeed, had I not witnessed these events personally, I would never believe that that was room in our grim and dark world for such fantastic marvels.<br><br>It all began when Geralt and I were feeling a bit peckish and, unburdened by heavy coin pouches, decided to fish our supper out of a lake. No bites were to be had, but we did not leave empty-handed - my hook snagged quite a lovely little pot. Oblivious to my friend's warnings, I opened it - and in doing so freed a powerful djinn.<br><br>Without giving it much thought I set about proclaiming my wishes. Before I could get to three, however, the djinn - irritated, I now see in hindsight, at being issued demands so soon after waking - started to throttle me. Geralt was able to drive him off, but I was left in a sorry state. I acted, the witcher told me later, as though under the influence of some curse. Clearly, the help of an expert in magic arcana would be needed.<br><br>It was our good fortune that Yennefer of Vengerberg happened to be staying in a nearby village. Geralt went to her to ask that she heal his best friend, who happened also to be the brightest star in the North's poetic firmament. Yennefer, however, was more interested in the djinn (which she wanted to trap into magic servitude) than in its victim, and, it should be said, played the witcher like a well-strung mandolin. Yet rather than grow angry at being used in such a calculating manner, he fell white head over muddy boots in love with her.<br><br>What happened then… well, I won't go into details, suffice to say that Yennefer's plans hardly delighted the djinn, and without its cooperation she proved unable to tame it. The sorceress would surely have met a tragic end - and taken all of Rinde along with her - had Geralt not rushed to her rescue. For once, he did not need to draw either of his blades: to send the djinn packing, he had but to pronounce his third and final wish. He could have asked for anything: wealth, fame, power… but instead he asked the djinn to bind his fate to that of the arrogant yet intriguing sorceress from Vengerberg.<br><br>Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, born 1232.

   1077310|9ee360bf||When Auberon Muircetach died, we lost not only our finest Sage and leader, but also our best chance to renew the gene of the Elder Blood. Prior to his, success seemed possible, even imminent. I had interpreted Cirilla's willingness to attempt to beget his child - despite her earlier resistance - as a personal triumph and a sign there was more of Lara in her than I had ever imagined possible.<br>Now, with all my designs shattered and the benefit of hindsight, I have concluded that putting pressure on here then in Tir ná Lia had a very negative effect on our relationship. Yet I could not have predicted that Muircetach had so little time remaining, and would squander it so foolishly, even though Cirilla was his for the taking.<br>Now my only hope lies in trying to regain her confidence and trust at any cost.
   1087431|9eedd515||The smallest of the Skellige Isles is also the birthplace of the islander's culture. Skelligers believe themselves direct descendants of Otkell, a legendary hero who was the first practitioner of the cult of Freya in the isles. He erected a beautiful temple in honor of the goddess on Hindarsfjall (sadly the temple has been closed to visitors in recent years due to concerns about the possible theft of the famous diamond, Brisingamen, ornamenting the goddess' statue). Otkell also constructed a fantastic garden near the temple - this can still be visited upon making prior arrangements with the priestesses' mother superior.<br><br>An enticing option for those wishing to visit Hindarsfjall  is the package excursion offered by the congregation of Freya worshippers in Poviss. Thanks to a longstanding agreement with the isle's priestesses, they can offer tours of all the local highlights at a very reasonable price. This is by far the best option for families with children or the elderly.

He did not even have the courage to slit my throat.<br><br>Yet, despite it all… I hope he brings her happiness – if so, I will rest in peace… But if he fails her, my ghost will haunt him to the end of his miserable life, and he will die as I have – alone and forgotten.

A further manifestation of the stupidity born of superstition is faith in the supposedly supernatural abilities of dreaming hags, who proudly style themselves oneiromancers. These mendacious persons convince the unwashed rabble they are able not only to dream the unknown past, but also to see the future yet to come as they sleep. Why, the very audacity of this talk inspires one to be ever more unyielding in our efforts to weed out this vermin. The City of Novigrad will soon be free of all sort of black magic, that worked by dreamers included.

Around the time of the break-in witnesses saw a thin, bald man rolling a barrel down the street and giggling to himself. The thief was also noticed to be singing a rude song in which he called himself "Odrin." If anyone knows the perpetrator's current whereabouts, they are asked to contact the injured party immediately.

   1055918|a6b552bc||Vridank the Elf<br>Despite what one might conclude from his moniker, not one drop of elven blood flowed in King Vridank's veins. They called him the Elf because of his exceptional beauty, and for the great admiration he felt for the Aen Seidhe. This fascination, seemingly harmless, would have horrible long-term consequences. King Vridank, spitting in the face of all laws and customs, chose as his wife a half-elf - and one of low status at that - known as Beatrix of Kovir. The fruit of this regrettable and short-lived mésalliance was Falka, who later fomented bloody revolt against her own father. Though this uprising was ultimately extinguished and Falka herself burned at the stake, the young state was thereafter thrown into chaos for years to come.

   1078903|a72f4fd2||Sirens, the harpies' distant relatives, are winged monsters found in the Skellige Archipelago, most frequently on unpopulated isles or in the inaccessible coastal areas of populated ones. According to legend they are daughters of the mythical winged giant Hräsvelg, who lives on the edge of the world and births gales with the waving of his wings. Hräsvelg's daughters seek out the company of giants and often make their nests near their lairs.<br><br>These creatures attack boats and ships from the air, tearing sails and rigging to shreds and rendering the vessels immobile. At times they will snatch men or cattle from the deck and drop them from great heights to their death. They also attack travelers trekking across isolated beaches.

Before they snap down from the heavens upon their prey like a divine whip, they let out a long, piercing shriek in warning, so that the victim may prepare itself for the imminent attack. Griffins do not fear to attack armed men - in fact, they prefer such prey, for defeating a knight flatters their pride. They even attack fiends, the terror of the Velen wilderness, so honorable is their nature.

   1084405|a99a7d72||Legend has it a beleaguered traveler once stood at this tower's gates. He begged shelter for the night, claiming he'd been injured, but the baron living inside was afraid the traveler was a spy and sent him away. Little did he know the traveler was a powerful mage, who cast a curse on the tower, its inhospitable owner and all who dwelled with him. Soon thereafter the baron and all his retinue died in mysterious circumstances, and the tower fell into ruin.

    320533|aa02ac6a||Sailors give Ard Hugtand, also known as the Isle of Death, wide berth - and not without reason. Treacherous currents have cast many ships against its rocky shores, and hungry beasts inhabit the island and the surrounding waters. Though the isle’s inlets tempt them with their vast shoals of cod and salmon, even the most experienced fishermen do not dare sail near it. There are legends as numerous as they are varied, telling both of ravines filled with gold nuggets and hurricanes which whip icy, bone-rending shards across its surface. An absolute ruler has reputedly lorded over the isle for centuries, tolerating no intruders. These legends, however, remain only that, for no one who has ever ventured to Ard Hugtand has returned to deny or confirm them.

   1062476|aabe47b6||I know not what we will do. Our food stocks ran out long ago, save for one sack of onions. For a week we have each eaten a few bites of onion a day, and nothing else. The children once detested onions, but now gobble their morsel greedily and suck on the skins. Soon our bag will be empty. We have no wood or fuel, and the snows keep falling. The mayor has been sending men door to door to hand out modest rations and a bit of wood from the lighthouse storeroom, but no one has come for days. I am not surprised. The snow is piled nearly to the top of our windows - no one could get to our door. I am afraid, so horribly afraid, that we will not outlast this winter...

   1062207|ab158ea9||Golems lack independent will and obey orders unconditionally – this is what makes them practical tools for both domestic and public service. A golem never wavers, hesitates or doubts, nor does it have any of the bodily needs of other creatures fit for servitude. Golems’ strength and endurance exceed that of any other humanoid being, and furthermore they do not complain, suffer from bodily aches or demand payment of any kind, requiring only the occasional bit of specialized conversation work to maintain their labor.

In such emergencies, prepare a copious container – a vat, a barrel, a bucket – anything large and watertight. Next fill it three-fourths of the way full with water (it is strongly advised not to exceed this amount, for the substance will boil as an alchemical side effect, which could lead a portion of it to spill out if the container is overfilled). The next step is to add<i>hillobarthus aurensis</i>extract, two drops for every liter of water, and then let the mixture sit for fifteen minutes. After that time has passed, apply a reverse secondary filtration formula, which by now you should be well familiar with.

   1025838|ae33ddfb||The reasons for choosing Jacques de Aldersberg as Grandmaster remain a mystery. The Order of the White Rose had gone through a crisis in those times and was on the verge of collapse, so one might guess that the brethren wished to have someone decisive as their leaders, someone with a clear vision. De Aldersberg was precisely such a man. One of his first decisions was to change the brotherhood's name to the Order of the Flaming Rose.<br><br>The most puzzling aspect, however, is that the order and the king himself decided to trust a man who, for all intents and purposes, had appeared out of nowhere. They say he was a wanderer, an itinerant priest who moved crowds with his speeches declaiming nonhumans. They say he worked miracles and showed his flock visions of a world destroyed by the White Frost. He was undoubtedly a man of great charisma, one instilled with unshakeable principles which he in turn tried to instill in others.<br><br>Was he truly a Source? Was he indeed gifted with raw magic talent? That we will never know for certain.

The rich man agreed to the loan on condition that the poor man return everything plus interest in seven day’s time. The sum was so large that the rich man was certain the poor man would not be able to pay it back. Then he would by law be forced to work for the rich man without pay. The poor man, however, proved the slier one – he bought warm, sturdy clothing and a strong horse, and then rode out of town.

Partly carved from the solid rock of the isle’s highest mountain, it makes a strong impression on all who behold it. Legend has it it was built by Grymmdjarr Iron Fang, son of Hemdall and Heulyn, founders of Clan an Craite. Grymmdjarr wanted a way to watch over all of Skellige to ensure no harm would come to his brothers, rulers of the other islands. So he wrapped heavy chains around a mountain resting on the sea floor, pulled it to the surface and placed it on the island of Ard Skellig. In seven days he carved out of it an impregnable fortress whose lofty towers afford a view of all the archipelago.

   1078031|af4964fe||My Dearest Master Sigvard,<br>I have received your letter. I thus now know that you have a great many doubts regarding the contract I have offered you - and that you clearly suffer from gross misconceptions regarding the nature of a mercenary's trade, something which, given that this is a trade you yourself profess to practice, constitutes a highly puzzling paradox. <br><br>So let me inform you that a mercenary is not paid for asking questions or listing reservations, but for performing a concrete task. This task was described in simple, unambiguous words: you are to capture a siren - <i>alive</i> - and bring her to me. If you will not perform this task, you are of no interest to me. As to why I need this siren, or what I intend to do with her, that should not be of any interest to you. If these conditions do not suit you, I am sure I will find another man who will not refuse my coin.<br><br>-Count de Botton

   1062216|b0341886||According to legend, Gabriella Maurienn, the founder of the Maurienn dynasty, was lover to Scarab, son of Godamba Thaess'en, progenitor of the Thyssenid dynasty. For this reason the Maurienns are considered kin to the royal dynasty, though no documents survive that confirm this blood tie with absolute certainty.<br><br>During its stormy history the Maurienn dynasty did not make very frequent use of its family ties to the court, though there were times when it did closely cooperate with it. Thus for example Franz Maurienn, grandson of Gabriella, was advisor to Guido Thyssen and his wife Klaudia of the Starhembergs. The chronicles tell us that while Franz dabbled mainly in healing and elemental magic, he also conducted experiments in necromancy. Guido Thyssen, who was fond of Franz's pleasant company and sense of humor, turned a blind eye to this. His detractors claim Franz repaid his patron several times over - as a result of the magic teas Franz would send on behalf of Guido to King Gerard Troydenid, Guido was settled in the Eastern March and given the title of margrave.

I'll bury the treasure and head to Novigrad. Should be able to find a decent man there to patch me up. Someone who won't ask questions. Who doesn't care if you're a deserter.<br><br>All that's left to me now is to pray that no one sees the tracks I left. That they don't follow the blood trail and find the treasure. But no one will come through here. I hope. Everything will be fine.

   1058767|b468f2da||When a traveler from the Northern Realms first crosses the border into Toussaint, he feels at once as though he has stepped into a land ripped straight from the pages of a fantastic fairy tale. He will know no inclement weather there, for even the winters in Toussaint are mild and sunny, with only gentle, calming breezes and not a hint of gale. He will know no hunger, for the trees and bushes of that land burst with ripe and juicy fruits all the year long. He will know no loneliness, for each and every soul he encounters will treat him like a long-lost friend. He will not find a single backwater of dullness, boredom or inquietude in this overflowing stream of marvel. In Toussaint the wine rages in torrents, music plays ceaselessly and everywhere the air is filled with the sound of birdsong and the twittering of beautiful maids, who are never stingy with their ample charms when a handsome knight comes a-calling. The capital of the duchy, Beauclair, is an architectural gem, full of glorious elven monuments: delicately soaring towers, masterfully carved reliefs and atmospherically mysterious ruins. Only the rare sun in a field of black, the odd gold and dark stain on an otherwise pristine edifice, reminds one that this land, this fable incarnate, is a vassal of Nilfgaard…

   1087560|b50ecfe5||Long before men first peopled these lands, a beautiful, prospering elven city stood here, centered around the palace of King Maeglor. One day, however, the city's inhabitants began mysteriously dying off in large numbers. According to legend, King Maeglor sensed he, too, would soon perish and cast a powerful spell that caused the earth to swallow the city whole so that no outsider could ever desecrate it. Centuries later, scholars from the Oxenfurt Academy began painstaking excavations of King Maeglor's palace in a search for the causes of the catastrophe. Yet work came to a sudden halt when three subsequent expeditions ventured into the ruins' depths - and were never heard from again...

Visiting here is a must for experienced travelers undeterred by unexplored wilderness and nature at its reddest in tooth and claw. Which is not to say that Faroe is uninhabited - just that its vibrant, primeval landscapes, not its human settlements, constitute its primary attraction.<br><br>Acting as sole exception to this, and providing a wonderful treat to adventure-seeking travelers, is the port of Harviken, the home village to Clan Dimun. With a bit of luck one might find oneself there when the clan's warriors return from their overseas raids and divide their plunder. A days-long feast is thrown in the warriors' honor afterwards - providing an excellent opportunity to sample local delicacies and observe local customs. For more on this, see the "Feasts and Festivals" chapter.

They are characterized, however, by an extreme instability that, as a general rule, interferes with magic conduction and causes fluctuations in the intersection’s poles. For these reason it is ill-advised to use such intersections for any undertaking requiring a steady and stable source of energo-magic power.

   1058793|b61d0e33||What is a nonhuman? The answer is simple. As the very name suggests, it is something which resembles, and yet nevertheless is not, a human. Though it walks on two legs, speaks a tongue similar to our own and dresses in similar attire, it all the same has more in common with base beast than noble man.<br><br>Dwarves are like moles. They feel best underground and avoid direct sunlight. They like to live in filth, forever smudging themselves in mud and slime. They love everything that can be found within the earth - rocks, metal, minerals of all shape and color. It is also said that, like their kindred moles, they feed most readily on worms, roaches and other nightcrawlers.<br><br>Halflings, for their part, are more reminiscent of gophers. Fat, lazy and loud in that typical rodent way, their minds are filled only with thoughts of food and drink, which they steal from other, nobler beasts and greedily squirrel away in their hovels. They are marked by a cruel craftiness. You could be dying of hunger and they would not share a meal with you. You could be howling from poverty, and they could be swimming in gold, and yet they would still fleece you to the last crown. You could do nothing but good to them, and they would still stab a knife in your back.<br><br>Elves, in turn, seem related to the birds of prey that dwell in far-off Zerrikania. They care most for colored feathers. They would most readily spend all day staring at their reflections in the water and singing their own praises. They are so awash in self-love that they no longer feel any desire towards members of the opposite sex of their own species. Their appearance, unquestionably pleasant to the eye, is highly misleading, for they are extraordinarily cruel and any who judge them by looks alone they first dupe and then kill in cold blood. The best proof of this? The so-called Scoia'tael, bandits that claim to fight for freedom, but in truth only long to kill humans.<br><br>All these vile so-called "elder" races are, to our great fortune, slowly dying out. Joy fills the heart of every right-thinking man at the thought that his great-grandchildren will never know them, that in their day dwarves, halflings and elves will be mere fairy-tale characters used to scare young, impressionable children.

   1083692|b723c58b||When he awoke, he saw before him an endless swath of blue. On the horizon the sky merged with the glassy sea. The storm had passed. So had the longship and all its crew. He never learned how long he had lain unconscious in the lifeboat.<br><br>The sun had scorched his skin a purplish red and turned his lips to brittle parchment. He was overcome by a great thirst, but there was nothing on the boat with which to quench it. Had he been spared from so much only to die now? No... Naransen was the son of the great Gunnestad and he would never give up. He had had twenty springs under his belt when he embarked on this voyage. When was that? Long ago... very long ago. Back when his friends still lived. When he still had his left hand, not this stiff stump. When his beard was still red and not streaked with silver.<br><br>The drive for glory which had driven him from his family home had demanded a high price. Naransen had never given that a second thought, but now, alone in a lifeboat in the middle of an endless ocean, he felt tired. He wanted to once again set eyes on the farm on which he had been raised. To see the eyes of his mother, who had lulled him to sleep with tales of the deeds of the legendary heroes. Now he had become one of them. Now mothers would tell their sons about him. His greatest dream had become reality. He should have been happy, but he wasn't. Perhaps if he had known then what travails and hardship awaited him...?<br><br>Yet no man can know his future. One thing is sure, however: even if Naransen had known what horrors this life had in store for him, he never would have chosen another. He was the son of the great Gunnestad and he had walked the path of Glory, from which one can never stray. No matter the cost.

I trust you will forgive my absence, but with my many years and many more injuries, travel is no longer possible. I thank you for sending your brothers to escort Agda – my own lads are all drinking mead with our ancestors, so if not for Ulf and Mikkel, Agda would have no worthy company on her journey to her wedding ceremony. To start you on your path together properly, I will entrust Agda's dowry to your brothers, on behalf of myself and all our clan. I also convey to you both my sincerest blessings. Respect each other and live in harmony. May you thrive and prosper.<br><br>Yorgen of Clan Heymaey

   1023013|b986b185||Lesbeth,<br><br>I’m very flattered by your interest in my humble greenhouse and naturally will describe to you how it works. Believe me – I’ve nothing better to do here. The witchers, being witchers, are tight-lipped, and even when they do finally say something it’s rarely anything very interesting. But enough of my complaints, let’s return to the greenhouse.<br><br>“Greenhouse” is, of course, merely a term of convenience, for this construction does not require any structure that could be called a house – it consists of three monoliths made of magic-absorbent stone (basalt is best, or porphyry, but granite will do in a pinch). The monoliths must be arranged in a triangle, and then charged with energy from the elements of fire and water.<br><br>Since a triangle has three vertices, there is no way to lay out the powers symmetrically – and that is precisely the point. The unstable arrangement will strive towards equilibrium according to the principle of the conservation of magic energy. Heat is a side effect of this process – and so, as they say in Beauclair,<i>voila!</i>, within the triangle conditions become like those of a greenhouse, favorable to the cultivation of exotic plants.<br><br>Two last remarks. First, charging all three monoliths with the same element will accomplish nothing – the arrangement will be stable and there will be no flow of energy. Second, the arrangement will naturally lose its charge over time and thus must be checked up on regularly – especially bearing in mind that once equilibrium is achieved, the temperature will fall and heavy precipitation will result, following the ancient principle<i>quod magia facit, natura laxit.</i><br><br>That will have to do for now. Your Hieronymus.<br><br>PS. Perhaps by way of thanks you could come visit me? True, the witchers have made me swear on all that is holy not to reveal where Kaer Morhen lies, but you, my dear, dear Lesbeth, can be trusted.

So here's my reckoning.<br><br>First off, Your Esquire's gotta know that I can scrummage up a few hayseeds from Claywich whenever you want, but that's what I'd call second-rate goods - geezers and squirts, mainly. But if Your Excellency thinks he can find use for even dregs like that, send us a messenger and within a week's time you'll get a transport full of them, trussed up like coneys.<br><br>I've also had a word or two with some soldiers who quit the baron's service after he got soused one night and jammed a hot poker in one of them's eyes. They've pitched two camps, one right next to the castle, the other near Velen's southern border - and as I'm sure Your Wondrousness has guessed, they're looking to make some quick coin. So if Your Most Reverend Sir can send us a few crowns as a deposit, why, we'll get to work on the double-quick and send you the prettiest dames and hardiest lads in all of Velen, maybe even in all the North - a hundred, two hundred, how ever many of them The Great Sergeant wants.<br><br>Your Humble Servant,<br><br>Dalegor.

   1058755|bba47ac4||Scholars have many vices. Possibly the worst among them is a tendency to describe the simple in unnecessarily complex terms, to dress the plain in the garb of false learning.<br>“The Conjunction of the Spheres” might serve as an excellent example of this. This name, so mysterious to a commoner's ear, could be replaced with a much simpler alternative: When the Worlds Collided. The phenomenon itself can also be explained in terms simple enough for a child to understand.<br>Imagine, dear reader, that our world is a ship sailing on a great sea. From its deck we can see other, distant vessels - those are the stars. These vessels each bear their own goods and their own crews. They usually pass us at some distance, barely visible specks, even viewed through a spyglass. Once every few thousand years, however, a storm breaks above this cosmic sea, a storm so strong it tosses the ships towards one another, making them sail cheek by jowl. Part of the crew of one ship can, at such times, move to another, and some of the cargo from one ship’s hold can spill onto a neighboring vessel. When the weather calms, the ships separate once again and sail their separate, invariably different ways.<br>The so-called “post-Conjunction beings,” namely monsters such as ghouls and basilisks, are precisely such passengers from another vessel. And we humans are castaways, flung against our will from somewhere far away onto a world previously inhabited by the Elder Races. Once here, we learned the arcane mysteries of magic, unbeknownst to us before.<br>Could the worlds collide once more? Perhaps. Can this cataclysm be avoided, or the opposite - hastened? Some scholars believe there are beings who have mastered this skill, who possess rare genes allow which some to seize the helm of our vessel and steer us… to safer waters, or to our doom.

   1058778|bd892204||It is commonly said that magic is neither good nor evil, that it transcends the moral criteria of men, that it depends on the mage whether it will be used for worthy goals or for shameful and immoral deeds. There is, however, one key exception to this principle - necromancy.<br><br>Proponents of this branch of magic once supposed that one can also do good by reviving corpses. Dead men can, after all, hide secrets which may save the living. It is better to send an army of reanimated corpses into battle than to squander the life of those in whose veins hot blood still flows. Moreover, a revived soldier may be reused many times, until such members are chopped off so as to make his flesh unusable.<br><br>Though it is hard to refute the logic of these arguments, the practice of necromancy is still forbidden. This is not at all based on the rabble’s superstitions about the living dead, nor the resistance of the powerful afraid those they have murdered could be forced to confess against them, nor the moral scruples of the older members of the Conclave, who were, in fact, laughed down as reactionaries when it was discussed. The fate of necromancy was sealed by the observation of Hen Gedymdeith, which was later confirmed by manifold experiences proving the revived dead are always unpredictable and reviving them always involves entirely negative side effects. In other words, no matter how noble a mage’s motives might be, necromancy will always lead to evil. It seems that in this way the gods let us know that we should not transgress the laws they have given us. And even the Conclave must respect the will of the gods.

   1082149|c05c057b||A band of soldiers attacked this village early one morning. They slaughtered most of the villagers in their beds, and the lucky few who fled to the woods in time had nothing left to return to.
   1083177|c0633e83||In a plane not unlike our own there once lived a ruler named Azgaryk. When he was an old man, he fell ill. He felt that he would soon die, so he summoned an evil spirit - Marbas - and made a deal with him. Azgaryk would live until his son came of age and ascended to the throne.<br><br>10 years passed. Azgaryk died, and next to his body Marbas appeared and turned to the heir to the throne:<br><br>"Your father promised me something. Now you must pay his debt."<br><br>"And just what did my father receive from you in return?" asked the heir. "And what do I owe?"<br><br>"Your life," said Marbas, and cut the heir's throat with his claw. The boy had not yet died when Marbas opened a gate to another plane. Out of it came a mercenary army, with the evil spirit Berith marching at its head.<br><br><br>Marbas sat on Azgaryk's throne. Ill times had come to the land. The people rebelled against the demon's rule. Marbas sent Berith and his army after them. Berith slaughtered all the rebels. His armor glistened with blood. People began to call Berith the Crimson Sovereign. Marbas' appetite was not sated, so he sent the Crimson Sovereign to conquer neighboring countries. And so it went on, for hundreds of years the Sovereign continued his march, losing soldiers as he went. But Marbas was never sated.<br><br>Finally, there came a time when the people of all the continents were united under Marbas' rule, and the Crimson Sovereign was left alone, without an army. He knelt before Marbas and said:<br><br>"You hired me and I have carried out my task. You promised me a weapon from which no shield can provide protection."<br><br>"You shall receive it," Marbas said, flashing his teeth. He reached into his garment and drew out a vial filled with plague bile.<br><br>He flung it at the Crimson Sovereign. Yet the Sovereign knew Marbas well enough to expect treachery. He opened a passage to another world and fled before the vial full of plague could hit the floor. Yet ill luck would have it that while he was fleeing, a gale came flying out of his open portal. It opened the window to Marbas' throne room and spread the plague bile out over the entire world.<br><br>Ever since Marbas has dwelled in a tower standing above a continent of dead bodies and beasts transformed by the plague. And Berith, still calling himself the Crimson Sovereign, wanders from world to world as a mercenary. Searching for vengeance.

   1083694|c162de62||One's attention immediately is drawn to the fact that their seemingly impoverished huts shine with cleanliness. The walls of their homes are usually made from pine and covered with a substance derived from sap which keeps out all manner of vermin. I believe it scares off insects as well, for I did not see a single one indoors during my entire stay in Skellige.<br><br>The interiors of their huts are quite spacious and usually divided into two rooms. The first is used by the members of the household during the day and is separated by a doorway from the second, which acts as a bedroom and contains only simple wooden beds covered with linens that resemble sacks more than Continental bedding.<br><br>In the middle of each main chamber stands a large round table around which the members of the household gather to eat only once a day. This usually happens just after dusk, the time for their main meal. This supper is a hallowed event and is carried out in a nearly ritualistic manner. At its start, before the family members have even taken their seats around the table, the eldest of the family tears off a piece of bread and places it on something of a household altar, which occupies a place of honor in each Skellige home. This serves as a symbol of respect for deceased ancestors. At the end of this ceremony for the departed, the entire family sits down to eat. The eldest woman places a steaming bowl in the middle of the table. Everyone has their own spoon, which they dip, one by one, into the basin of food. They most often eat porridge, over which they pour a gravy made from meat or fish.<br><br>Curiously, immediately upon the supper's conclusion the eldest takes the piece of bread set aside at the start of the meal and places it in a large amphora. As I later learned, when an amphora becomes full, it is filled with boiling water and a beverage is brewed which in taste somewhat resembles beer, though it is much weaker.

   1057917|c1ade024||To change form - to shape one’s matter as clay - this is no novice’s trick, no flickering glowlight or rat-killing blue bolt. Only those with bowels soaked in oceans of magic arcana - and few are born with bowels so absorbent - can hope to master it.<br><br>There are exceptions, of course. Dragons, as is well known, possess such a talent innately. With no need for study they can, guided by some otherworldly intuition, change between humanoid and reptilian form. As for the other races, higher vampires (e.g.. bruxae) are known to flicker between states, yet given the understandable difficulties of conducting research in this area, we do not know if this transition constitutes an act of polymorphy.<br><br>The human race is, obviously, much more accessible to scholars of polymorphy. Their years of study have borne fruit in the form of a set of methods and guidelines for the identification, nurture and deployment of this talent. The most accomplished result of the careful application of these methods - Philippa Eilhart.

    469928|c213a67b||To follow the example of the sorcerer from the tower, we first need to classify substances, diving them into superior and inferior varieties. Only the former can be described by the theory of interdependence presented here.<br><br>Inferior substances do not produce a chain of quasi-life structures, for their nature is substandard in quality and they cannot exist independently. However, it has been proven that they are paradoxically essential for the chain to exist in spite of their inferiority. The hypothesis of interdependence assumes that the chain of quasi-life must contain one substance of each superior element. Nonetheless, the chain's structure, proposed by Raffard the White, has one too few paces for them, namely only five. If the chain were transposed and then transmuted, the problem would easily be solved. Alas, the first operation cannot be performed without damage to the chain's integrity. The only solution is to use a so-called reversed transmutation, which will eventually cause the chain to rotate. As a result of rotation all six superior substances will constantly leave and join the chain without destroying it. From the holistic point of view, there will always be six superior substances occupying five places. The ingenuity of this solution lies in the chain having all the qualities of the three inferior substances. Thus the paradox of interdependence, or as some say coexistence, is no longer a problem.<br><br>Unfortunately, since none of the modern works describe how to perform reverse transmutation, the problem of animating the inanimate remains unresolved.

How he killed Johann for not taking off his cap quick enough. How he trampled our fields when drunk with nary a thought of repayment. How he barged in during Pieter's wedding and demanded his right of the first night. Now we've finally got what we begged Melitele for in our prayers for so long - the judge recognized our grievances and waived all our bonds and duties to the lord.

Hovel's not much of a village yet, but to my mind it's better than the most fantastic palace.

Mother said it's foolish to spend so much on a bauble when we haven't ploughs nor hoes and that we ought return it to the merchant. Over my dead body! I'll never take it off. It'll always be there to remind me of Volker - of how happy we were that day.<br><br>23 IV 1250<br><br>They say the lord is coming to see us. That he wants to make a deal, to beg us to return to the village. They say he's calmed since his son died, that he's not as quick to anger about small slights. Well, we'll see.

Making a mold of the key with a lump of clay - damned clever, can't believe I didn't think of it meself! I strolled right into the armory after dark, Kuliu was lying there right where you said, in a case, wrapped in oilcloth. What a blade! Fits your hand like a toothsome lass's tit, point's sharp as a needle, hilt's set with gems… Stared so hard I didn't hear that fool Olaf coming. He would've caught me had he not tripped and smacked his gob into the ground. Seems the gods are lookin' after us!<br><br>So now we've got to sell the blade - and that won't be easy. Not many got that kind of coin, and them who do don't want to cross Crach. Luckily, my brother Yrjan knows a merchant, fellow named Gimre, who always finds willing buyers for "second hand" goods. They're going to meet in the old fortress near Fyresdal. Maybe they'll make a deal with Lugos? He's got heaps of gold - and not a drop of fear for an Craite.<br><br>Cheers to you, old goat!<br>Sveinar<br>

    458855|c807167f||Sveinar - I got good news and bad. I'll start with the bad… Me and Gimre went to Lugos. Gave us the welcome custom demands, mead and meat aplenty. But as soon as we unwrapped Kuliu from its leather and asked how much he'd give us for it, he ripped the blade from our hands and knocked us both on our arses, calling us thieves. He then sent us running from his house, hounds at our heels. Gimre runs slow, so they got him. That's fine - only means a bigger cut for us.<br><br>Now here's the good news - we still got the sword, and now I know how to get rid of it. I talked to Steinfinn, me brother in law, and he'll sell Kuliu in Novigrad and split the coin with us after. I know, I know, but I swear, you can trust him. I'll give him the sword on the beach by the whale cemetery on Ard Skellig. I'll go alone, so as not to attract attention.<br><br>Watch out, Lugos might have sent a messenger to Kaer Trolde to inform them of the theft. Just in case, hole up somewhere - maybe with Aunt Hilde? She's not right in the head, but you can rely on her anyway.<br><br>Cheers,<br>-Yrjan

   1058770|cb9d6409||One can hear Ithlinne's Prophecy whispered at every market, garbled and reused by every village witch, delved into in any treatise touching on sooths and diviners and in general saturating our common culture. We all know that "the time of the Wolf's Blizzard approaches, the Time of the White Frost" and that "the world will perish amidst ice." But few truly understand the meaning of these words.<br><br>The self-proclaimed prophets who shout out Ithlinne's words mistake stars reflected in a still pond for the sky. For the White Frost is no legend or mythical apocalypse. It is a natural phenomenon that can be described in the dry yet precise language of scholarship.<br><br>The renowned scholar of Thorn's studies have clearly shown that our world is not the center of the universe, but one of a thousand such globes spinning in the endless darkness of space. This space is usually described as a vacuum - yet to do so is grossly misleading, for through this "vacuum" swims, invisible to the naked eye, the White Frost.<br><br>We do not know exactly what the White Frost is - perhaps a microscopic dust that blocks the incoming light of the sun? Perhaps infinitesimal particles of the sort postulated by Democritus of Ban Ard, with the unusual property of sucking up warmth as a sponge does water?<br><br>We know for a certainty however, that, thanks to the telescopic observations of elven astronomers, the White Frost, whatever it is, has already destroyed a great many worlds. The star systems in which it appears perish into lifeless hunks of ice over the course of a few decades. Furthermore, each scholar is agreed that the White Frost will one day come to our world. Ithlinne's Prophecy, though based on magic intuition and not scientific observation, thus appears to foretell the truth.<br><br>Many mages are skeptical about the theses presented here. I recommend they carry out the same experiment I have conducted in my own laboratory. Using the spell<i>Portus Asterum</i>, open a microscopic portal for three and a half seconds to the coordinates 03 31 48 90, 89 27 09 34.

   1046641|d04b17c0||Glossary
   1061797|d055438d||Empire and North crossed swords again in 1267 to 1268. Mage treachery had erupted on Thanedd, and Nilfgaard could no longer sit idly while the North let magic sow destruction freely. The Imperial Army took Lyria at lightning speed, meeting little resistance. After short sieges, our forces marched into Rivia and Vengerberg, each time greeted by jubilant crowds thirsty for peace and civilization. Then they moved against Aedirn.<br><br>(…) King Demavend’s attempt to stop the Golden Sun’s triumphant march failed, and his forces were pushed back to the Pontar Valley and Dol Blathanna.<br><br>(…) Queen Meve began the formation of partisan bands made up of bandits and outlaws, of which the North has never been short.<br><br>(…) Displaying typical Nordling treachery, King Henselt signed an agreement with the Empire behind his allies’ backs, leading to the partition of Aedirn.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty, in an act of supreme benevolence, created an elven state in Dol Blathanna, thus forging a bulwark of tolerance against the abhorrent racist laws of the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) King Foltest of Temeria signed a truce with imperial forces. Yet the Nordling’s word proved to be of as much worth as the snow melting on the fields that spring. The truce lasted a mere sixteen days before it was violated. Foltest’s stupidity led to the Slaughter of Brugge, and then to a range of bloody battles in the Yaruga valley. Faced with senseless and uncontrolled violence, the imperial army leadership decided to tamp the bloodshed and retreat to Sodden.<br><br>Sadly, Foltest’s greed meant that hostilities resumed with the coming of spring. Their culminating point came with the Battle of Brenna, where our heroic regiments faced a combined Temerian-Redanian army. To this day the North considers that battle a turning point in the war. There is no point in polemicizing with this conviction. Much more important is the fact that this battle saw the confrontation of two strategies: an honorable one, presented by the imperial army’s leadership, and one of trickery and subterfuge, conducted by the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Highness realized where the conflict was going. The Northern Armies were employing scorched-earth tactics, caring not for the pain they inflicted on the civilian population. Disgusted and unwilling to participate in this type of war, Nilfgaard withdrew its armies to the south. This was mistakenly seen by the Nordlings as an admission of defeat.<br><br>(…) Thanks to the Emperor’s mediation, an armistice was written up and eventually signed in Cintra, putting an end to the Second Northern War.

I know others got hunger to deal with, that it's a sin to complain... But what can I do. I'm sick to death of fish, had too damn much of pulling their bones out from between my teeth, of shitting out their scales.<br><br>But instead of sitting and complaining about life, it's better to change it. And it so happens Sobiemir saw a pirate ship sink to the bottom not far off the coast. We're both good swimmers, so if the sea stays calm, we'll dive down and see what sort of treasure's lying in its hold. And then, I swear to Melitele - I'll never eat another fish as long as I live.

   1080842|d2836488||Yestereve Nordrada popped her clogs. For long years she'd played on our pity, begging for alms and her due as a lone widow without kin. Yet 'twas all lies. We went to ready her body for burial, and lo and behold, behind her stove sat a sack bursting with grain, beans and peas, and next to it a satchel of dried apples and mushrooms.<br><br>We summoned the ealdorman at once and decided as follows: the food we'll parcel out to everyone in the village, and Nordrada we'll deny a proper burial, tossing her into the swamp with a stone tied to her legs instead, so that she may never know peace after death. Let this be a sign to all who steal for themselves at the cost of others and hide food from the rest of the village while covering it up with lies. Such shall be cursed by gods and man.

   1059396|d2fb0dc8||What exactly is the Elder Blood?<br>According to some, it is a powerful elven curse passed from generation to generation. Those in whose veins the infamous <i>Hen Ichaer</i> flows are said to carry death and destruction within them, to sow hatred and disdain in the hearts of men. It was from this contaminated blood that Ithlinne prophesied an avenger would be born, a destroyer of nations and worlds.<br>Others claim the Elder Blood is an extremely rare inherited talent, granting control over time and space to a degree unattainable even to elven Sages. Sadly, few bearers of this gift have been able to control it in full. This merely partial mastery inevitably leads to sudden outbursts of the Power that take the form of unpredictable, uncontrollable and thus extremely dangerous explosions. Behind the dark legends about the Curse of the Elder Blood lies the truth of these tragic cases.<br>For obvious reason the bearers of the Elder Blood were always subjects of great interest to the world's mighty and to mages alike. The former counted on the truth of Ithlinne’s prophecy, on an avenger being born who could destroy worlds, and who they could thus use for their purposes. As for the latter, they hoped to harness the magic of <i>Hen Ichaer</i> to broaden their own knowledge and powers.<br>Ultimately, however, all these plans were for naught - the Elder Blood line broke off with the disappearance of the heiress to the Nilfgaardian crown, Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon…

   1021668|d9164441||Tristianna did not care a whit for her stepmother’s admonitions. She would toss off her ragged foot wrappings and walk barefoot instead. She would wear Koviri lace and batik knickers under her rough hairshirt. And when dusk fell and the other novices dutifully went to offer their evening prayers, she would slip off quietly and run down to the bay, where Isador awaited her. This merry devil was thick as a barn and had hooves instead of feet – but Tristianna like him all the same, more than anyone else in the world. For him, she broke off her betrothal and defied her family’s will. She knew that if their bond was ever discovered both she and Isador would be burned at the stake, and so in the dark hours of night she planned their escape.

   1021730|dacb1ce0||And should we thus submit our life to religion, or should we interpret religion so that it serves our lives instead? There are as many schools as there are philosophers, as many stories as there are human beings (and let us not forget elven beings, nor dwarven, halfling, gnomish ones, nor any other such sapient creature familiar with the quandaries of the soul). I, for my part, having survived now more than one hundred and twenty years (vodka and radishes work wonders, lend no creedence to anyone who claims differently), can swear with all certainty that there is no way to reconcile everyone at once, and what pleases one will provoke whingeing and sulking in another, and will undoubtedly cause a third to reach for his knife if it dares depart from his known, narrow world by so much as a hair. What then are we to do? How should we live? Why, as we like, as our soul urges, disregarding all the brayings of philosophers and ethicists, those contained in this tome included - disregard them as we would fairy tales or old wives’ legends.

    477514|dc7ed317||(…) The island folk of Skellige, like many nations of the North, hold a series of beliefs about the Wild Hunt as recorded in legends, myths and fables. This horrifying phenomenon is said to herald the coming of war and misfortune. Characteristic of their tales, and distinguishing them from their continental versions, is that the islanders imagine the Wild Hunt not as a cavalcade of wraiths galloping across the night sky, but as a ghostly longship. The vessel, called the Naglfar, is said to be built of "the claws of dead men." For this very reason, superstitious Skelligers remove the nails of their dead, expressly to prevent them from being used to fortify this ghastly ship. In many legends the Naglfar sails out of Morhogg - the land of chaos (…)

Poor Gaspard had to listen to the constant complaints of customers who would charge into his office in a huff about Vegga’s behavior. Yet the girl clung firm to her principles and her ironclad drive to see them through. She would never perform with any lights lit and would avert her gaze with a powerful blush upon catching sight of the male member. Gaspard’s greatest headache, however, was the fact that virtuous Vegga never, ever accepted any payment for her services (…)

Sadly, we still conduct trials in the inheritance of magic ability using, let us say, natural methods. The results of these pseudo-experiments far too often can be seen in the gutters of our cities and begging outside our temple walls. Far too often we see and encounter brain-dead and moronic women, women covered in their own spittle and passing themselves as prophetesses, seers, village diviners and miracle workers – cretins with brains degenerated by the uncontrolled Power they inherited.<br><br>These simpletons and fools can themselves breed, can pass on their “abilities” and continue the degeneration. Is anyone capable of foreseeing or defining what the last link in such a chain will look like?<br><br>Most of us mages lose the ability to procreate as a result of changes and disruptions to the functioning of our pituitary glands. Others – sorceresses, most often – mature into their magic powers with gonads intact. They can conceive and give birth – and have the audacity to consider that good fortune, a blessing. Yet I repeat: no one is born a mage. And no one should be! Aware of the gravity of what I write, I provide an answer to the question posed at the Summit in Cidaris. I answer with every certitude: each of us must decide what she wants to be – a sorceress or a mother.

   1077534|dd27da3f||A long, long time ago, in a place far, far away there lived an old bear. One day the bear went into the woods to look for honey. He found an old birch with a hole in it, and peered inside. Wild bees had made a hive there, but they were gone, and there wasn't any honey, either. The bear scratched his fuzzy head, paced around a few times, then set off to a nearby village.<br><br>The sun stood high in the sky and most of the villagers were out working in the fields, harvesting their crops. When the bear entered the village, a group of children playing hopscotch ran away in fear. The old bear shambled over to the larder. With one swipe of his heavy paw he knocked off the latch and walked inside, scaring off a fat ginger cat whose whiskers were covered in cream.<br><br>When they heard the noises coming from the larder, the children crept out of their hiding places and peeked inside. Soon enough, out came the bear. And what a sight that was! The bear walked on his two hind legs and had a great sack slung over his back as he strolled towards the freshly-harvested fields. Soon all the village was staring as the furry creature walked the furrows, sowing seeds from his sack. When the bear finished, he tossed the sack on the ground and returned to his cave.<br><br>Weeks passed. Fall came, and then the frosts of winter, until finally spring melted the snows. The seeds the bear had planted sprouted and covered all the fields with golden flowers. Soon bees were hovering above the flowers, gathering nectar in the hot sun.<br><br>There was honey enough for the both the bees and the villages, with plenty left over afterwards for the very happy old bear.

   1061871|dd61ca57||Redania is a kingdom belonging to the so-called League of Northern States. It is located between the Buina and Pontar rivers, bordered by Temeria to the south and Kovir and Caingorn to the north. To its east lies Kaedwen, and to its southeast - Aedirn. Its capital is Tretogor, yet the land's most famous settlements are Oxenfurt, home to the enclave of culture and learning that is the Oxenfurt Academy, and Novigrad, which, while a Free City, stands on Redanian soil.<br><br>The cult of the nobility runs strong in Redania. That social stratum possesses more privileges here than in any nearby realm. Great differences in wealth exist among the gentry, but Redanian law cares for birth not property, making a well-born beggar the legal equal to the richest magnate. Those of high birth and great wealth draw the latter primarily from the grain trade and pedigreed horse husbandry. This last the Redanians excel in above all other peoples - Redanian steeds are unsurpassed, making the Redanian cavalry among the best in the world, and the nobility which fills its ranks the heart of the Redanian armed forces. As a consequence of the nobility's privileged position, the peasantry is treated worse here than in neighboring kingdoms, and only the king’s iron fist keeps them from rebelling.<br><br>The Redanian army consists of thirty-five thousand armed men, in which number is counted a core of four thousand elite knights. After the outbreak of the Third Nilfgaardian War, Redania’s forces were further supplemented with Temerian and Kaedweni regiments, as well as with mercenary troops from Poviss and Kovir. Indeed, one can now accurately speak of a united Northern army under the leadership of King Radovid V.<br><br>The Redanian treasury relies on the profitable trade with Novigrad to fill its coffers, with wheat being the chief staple crop. Redania has this in abundance - it is often called the granary of the north, for its landscape consists almost entirely of rolling fields of wheat. Yet despite its lands natural bounty, Redania's economy has been in a state of crisis ever since the outbreak of war with Nilfgaard. The tumult and desperation has led, in recent days, to the cult of the Eternal Fire has been gaining more and more adherents.

This is not at all surprising, given that the witnesses to these monsters' appearances are usually simple shepherds frightened witless by the monstrous winged creature shrieking above them. Yet that does not make it any less of a colossal and profound error.<br><br>Both forktails and wyverns are much, much smaller than dragons. True, they hunt animals in open fields, cattle in particular, just like those nobler beasts, but their behaviors and methods for dealing with potential prey could not be more different.

They need folk for the silver mine, they say, and no one ever lasts more than two months there anyway, so every hand helps. Fine by me. Business is good. Only thing worrying me is that soon I'll have caught all the peasants around, and then who'll I sell?

   1021722|de34ce1e||Freya Modron, the Great Mother, teaches us to put our faith in her no matter what life brings. Thus warriors pray to her before setting off for battle, and the women they leave behind pray for their menfolk’s safe return. Freya, as a mother and a goddess, understands all the trials of mankind, she sooths our pains and provides comfort. Yet woe to him who acts against her and violates her eternal laws, handed down for the good of men and the world. Condemnation awaits such men – they will be cut off from the life-giving source of motherly love, and if they repair not their ways and, renouncing evil, return to the mother-goddess’ bosom, they shall be cursed for all eternity – they and all their line (...)

   1080348|de3c5d46||We hunkered down for the night in a cave so enormous the light from our torches faded into the murky black without revealing any upper bound to it. For most of the night, all we could hear was the rushing of water somewhere behind the wall of the cave. Yet after some time (it is hard to say how much, for we had lost all sense of where day ended and night began) we heard a sort of scraping noise, and then the sound of boulders shifting.<br><br>The scraping turned to a roar, but by that time we were already on our feet and running towards the tunnel through which we had entered the cave. We did so none too soon, for the shifting had opened up a new passage in the cavern, which began to spew out hordes of small, misshapen humanoids. Without breaking stride I looked over my shoulder, and in the midst of the mass of midgets I spied the outline of a large, black troll.<br><br>Thus began our run for our lives.

   1078027|ded0243c||I've had enough. My father and brother think I'm nothing. All they do's laugh at me, they're always laughing. Saying my face is fair as a maid's, and I'm only fit for lying in bed with maids and certainly not for battling with men. And one day one of those cuckolded husbands is going to break my neck... True, never have had much problem securing ladies' affections, but that's not something I asked for...<br><br>Marie wouldn't let me leave her bedchamber, so we dallied on till her husband, Noorhis Ironsides, and his mates came back with their lootings. I jumped into a wardrobe and stayed to listen, though it was uncomfortable as all get out. They said they'd sunk some great treasure ship by the rocks between Faroe and Ard Skellig, and that come morning they intended to go fish it out. Once they'd drunk themselves to sleep, I slipped out of the wardrobe and told Marie we should slit all their throats, get that treasure ourselves and leave these horrible isles, go somewhere better - Kovir, or even Novigrad!<br><br>Marie didn't take long to convince, because her husband was a true whoreson and beat her terribly, so Noorhis and his mates are bits in a fish's guts by now, and I'm off to find my fortune.<br><br>Who cares that I'm not too skilled a sailor and a storm's coming? I'll be done and gone before hit hits!

   1076446|df45c80c||Jester had one task. ONE. To write incantations on the ribbons used in creating the golem. And what did he do? Made a dog's dinner of it, of course - and as a result, instead of a guard we have a murderer walking our lab. And I asked, "Did you double check the incantations?" "Oh, aye, yessiree.""Are you sure?" "Sure as shooting, aye." And yet the results prove otherwise.

   1021723|dfe9a6bd||And so, I, Jacob the Rebel, once well-known as a libertine and brawler extraordinaire from Nazair with its myriad taverns to the wilds of Zerrikania, used what strength I had left to pull my craft ashore. The raft I had strapped together out of an old boot, bits of strap and a burst barrel had taken on so much water that two ells more and I'd have sunk to the bottom. Instead, I stood on dry land, and that was all that mattered. With not a living soul in sight and my stomach growling something mighty, I began to explore. The isle was bereft of game, but offered fruit in great abundance. I ate so heartily the juice nearly poured out my ears, and then I began to gather wood with which to build my shelter for the night and fuel the fire that would warm me. <br><br>It was then I came upon the strange plant that would change my life till the end of my days. Ignorant of its value at this time, I frivolously used it for kindling. Yet as soon as it began to smolder and its sweet scent filled my nostrils, I felt light and the coastal breeze whisked all my troubles away.<br><br>I devoted the subsequent years of my life to researching this miraculous weed and its properties. As a result, I was able to develop a method that is likely to transform the life of any who puts it into practice. Here is how to begin… (…)

Da always said a wise man learns from others' mistakes, so here I am, learning from his - and instead of dying for Temeria, I'm going to rob those who killed Temeria's sons. We've pitched a camp, got us a great spot, middle of the woods, near that old mill. Now we're all set to go out on our first raid.

You ever think about that? No, you didn't, ever since you were a lad you always acted first, thought later - or never. But you ain't a lad no more, so put an end to this reckless adventure and head home.

    441253|e3a31e17||What worries me most, brothers and sisters, is our moral decay. Townsmen disdain their marital beds and instead seek out loose women to fulfill their manly desires. Their wives return the favor and look for any opportunity to cuckold them. Their children are either born bastards or dispatched with the help of witches. There is more traffic to the so-called pleasure houses than to our temple, despite the fact that one is more likely to find rot within their walls than any pleasure. Men sleep with men, women with women, human with nonhuman.<br><br>What next, I ask? What will our depravity bring us next? Will man marry goat? Will premarital intercourse become a commonplace affair? No, brothers and sisters! The Eternal Fire must burn away these sins! The Fire - and only the Fire - can cleanse us!

When he traversed the isle for the first time and found no place worthy of making his seat, he asked Hemdall to give him the thickest chain he could forge. Once he received the chain, Grymmdjarr dove into the depths of the sea and used it to drag an enormous rock to the surface, placing it on Ard Skellig's north-eastern shore. Then he carved Kaer Trolde out of this rock with his bare hands, and there it stands to this day, the pride and glory of his clan.

   1055941|eb9f2560||As for the genesis of ghouls, there are hypotheses aplenty. Some scholars claim these monstrosities arose from scoundrels who indulged in a taste for human flesh and for this misdeed drew the wrath of the heavens down upon themselves. The gods punished them by taking away their souls, their minds and their human forms.<br><br>My experiments have shown, however, that ghoul anatomy displays far too little in common with that of humans for this thesis to seem at all probable. Any and all similarity in appearance between ghouls and men, such as their somewhat kindred shapes and the measures of their physiognomies, are pure matters of incidental circumstance. It thus follows that ghouls, like their vile cousins the alghouls, are post-Conjunction creatures – that is to say, such beings as came to our universe in an abrupt cataclysm disrupting the normal laws of nature.

    477516|ec608ced||Brother druids,<br><br>Be forewarned that a sorceress has arrived on Ard Skellig. Her name is Yennefer and she hails from Vengerberg. I know you are immune to feminine wiles and will not let a well-draped skirt muddle your reasoning. Nevertheless, I warn you not to be taken in by her intelligence and refinement. I know who Yennefer is – I do not, however, know the true goal of her stay in Skellige. I see no point in asking her this question directly, for Yennefer is known for her cunning and eloquence. She says not what she thinks, but what she wishes you to hear. You must remember this is no second-rate sorceress. This is a person who breaks bread with the rulers of the North and who most recently has been working with the Nilfgaardian emperor himself. Familiar with courts the world over, she possesses an ability to manipulate that even the wiliest diplomat would envy.<br><br>Yennefer has displayed an unhealthy interest in the site of the cataclysm we are striving to study. I have not given her permission to go near it, but I caution you to keep your eyes and ears open all the same. The sorceress from Vengerberg is a stubborn and effective manipulator. I know that in the past her and Crach’s paths crossed. I suspect that she will wish to use this old friendship for some ulterior purpose. What that is, exactly… I will try to determine. Once I do, I will inform you in a separate letter.<br><br>May the Power be with you, Brothers<br>Ermion

   1061803|eda9be4c||Emhyr var Emreis rules to expand. He trains his strategic brilliance on a singular vision - conquering the world, though he (rightly) calls this not conquest, but salvation. Yes. The emperor of Nilfgaard sets the world alight with the torch of civilization.<br><br>Climbing over his fathers' usurpers’ still-warm bodies, the emperor seized the throne and began assimilating the Northern Realms, one after another. Terror engulfed the north. Only the Battle of Brenna slowed the imperial armies’ victory march. Then a temporary peace took hold, though none believed that mirage. Emhyr’s aim, to make the entire North a Nilfgaardian vassal, remained unchanged. Emhyr used the cover of peace to intensify his political operations. Now all can see their results - chaos and disorder devour the Nordlings’ states. Ridden with internal bickering and backstabbing, they near collapse. Only a strong ruler can grapple this dysfunction into function. Only a wise ruler can give vision to their blindness. Only Emhyr var Emreis can save the North. That is why our armies have crossed the Yaruga - for the third and final time…

   1057896|f0fec9e6||Broddr, founder of Clan Dimun, whose members dwell on the Isle of Faroe, was an extraordinarily good and fair man, giving advice and help to all who came to him. He loathed looting and deception and never told a lie - in short, he was a paragon of virtue. He ruled his people wisely and lived to a venerable age. At the dusk of his life he was summoned before Hemdall, but a whale devoured his longship and he never reached his journey's end. Ever since, descendants of his line have hunted whales in search of the bones of their great and beloved ancestor.

   1087425|f22f8341||What time of year is the best for visiting Ard Skellig? Any time. To whom is such a sojourn recommended? To anyone who seeks adventure, craves miraculous views and adores charming villages. These last Ard Skellig has in spades: it is the most densely-inhabited isle in the archipelago, though this does not mean it lacks virgin forests or untrammeled landscapes. Particularly worthy of a visit are the villages of Rannvaig, Arinbjorn and, last but not least, Holmstein, one of the most important ports in all the Isles.<br><br>Anyone lucky enough to enjoy the sea voyage to Arinbjorn will surely notice the majestic lighthouse guiding ships to its harbor. Built at the behest of the famed Jarl Skjordal, it constitutes one of the most fascinating spots on the isle and offers breathtaking views of the entire region.<br><br>The most spectacular vista on Ard Skellig, however, must certainly be that of Kaer Trolde, a fortress cut out of the mountain overlooking the bay and serving as home seat to the powerful an Craite clan. According to legend, Grymmdjarr, mythical Skellige hero and founder of Clan an Craite, carved the fortress with his bare hands (for more on this, see the "History" and "Culture" sections).

   1068459|f254740c||Such is my quest - to wander the villages of this fair land of Velen singing the praises of Maid Bilberry. I shall bring due fame to her unequalled beauty and unparalleled charms. Maid Bilberry is without a doubt the most intelligent, most understanding and most compassionate of all creatures to walk this our imperfect world. I shall immediately and with full prejudice correct any man who dares to claim otherwise. The most stubborn and foolhardy of these ignorami shall taste of my family blade. Indeed, just the other day I came across a certain gentleman fondling some tart and having the cheek to call her "my most beautiful little flower." This enraged me so egregiously that I decided to explain to the fool the magnitude of his error, but he refused to listen, and when I insisted further, he fled. This truly is a land of cowards. I shall not rest until I've convinced all the locals that they should direct their compliments to Maid Bilberry - and only Maid Bilberry.

Not that I don't trust you, but the gods help those who help themselves, as the Kaedweni saying goes.<br><br>Getting straight to your question: Princess Adda's curse could indeed be caused to return. The witcher from Rivia had only a rudimentary knowledge of magic arcana, and so was not able to fully remove the spell, and instead only temporarily disrupted its workings.<br><br>For Adda to become a striga once more, one would have to sprinkle her food with three drops of blood from her father, King Foltest, three drops of blood from a wolf and three drops of bile from a freshly-buried woman, one who died having finished one hundred years but not yet having started her hundred and first. Then one must cast the Incepted Triangle over the meal thus prepared. That should do the trick - yet please consider carefully whether you truly wish to carry out such an ignoble deed.<br><br>Hoping to do business again with you in the future,<br><br>-Alyssandra Deviel

   1058758|f48914f5||Running through many folk tales is a common motif of travel between worlds. By way of example, think of Orphelius, who ventured into the nether realms to save his beloved, Theodor, who, fleeing a hurricane, found himself in the drab and monotonous world of Zo, or Ecila, who tumbled down a ferret hole into a land that had never heard of wonder. Also of this ilk are the many rural legends about people captured by the Wild Hunt, only to return to their homelands after years riding the sky with the spectral cavalcade.<br><br>Academia has, for the most part, dismissed these tales as mere epiphenomena of human irrationality. I, on the other hand, always operate on the assumption that a grain of truth lies in every tale - and so have decided to make it my goal to find it. After years of research, I have ascertained with great certainty that travel between worlds was once indeed possible - though only to a select few.<br><br>The key is the so-called “Elder Blood” - or rather, to use the scholarly term, the gene of Lara Dorren, the powerful elven sorceress. By comparing her genealogical tables against all known folk tales I have been able to determine that she and her descendants were the archetype of the worlds-traveling heroes of many legends. The bearers of Lara’s gene possessed an extraordinary talent which allowed them to move through time and space and to reach realms beyond the borders of the known world. The overwhelming majority of them, however, did not know how to control this. It would only manifest itself in extreme situations, pushed out by sudden bursts of emotion or when the bearer’s life was at risk.<br><br>That is how the above-mentioned Orphelius, in shock after the death of his wife, could in fact journey to another world, which he foolishly mistook for the afterlife. The hurricane provided the pressure needed for Theodor, terrorized at home by his zany Uncle En, to unleash his talent and teleport to a world free from madcap antics. And if we read between the lines, we clearly see Ecila was a prostitute and a fisstech addict - the “ferret hole” represents how, when she had reached rock bottom, she whisked herself away to another universe to get sober.<br><br>Unfortunately for any future Ecilases, the sad conclusion of my research is this: Lara Dorren’s line has been irrevocably cut off. The last bearer of her gene, Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon, heiress to the throne of Cintra, died childless many years ago.

   1053347|f658b69b||Once Oxenfurt was a renowned university city, the capital of learning and liberty. The outbreak of war brought Redanian troops to the city, with King Radovid at their head. The university was closed, the students were driven out and the entire town began to feel like an extension of the infamous prison found within its walls.

Some reminders for men who'll join a raid for the first time this spring:<br><br>–Abandon your shield, and you'll be clobbered to death with it.<br>– Desert the battlefield, and a stone'll be hung round your neck and you'll be drowned in the open sea.<br>– Fail to slay at least one foe during the raid, and you'll have to shave off your beard and moustache when you return.

Your presence warmed our hearts, and the sweet notes with which you serenaded us so touched my wife’s mother, the Baroness Deuvlett (called in some circles a cold and heartless bitch), that tears of tender emotion appeared in her eyes.<br><br>Bohmil de Rabbe

   1061924|f7269743||During my many travels I have seen countless extraordinary places - the primeval wilds of Brokilon, with trees so high their tips disappear in the clouds, dwarven chambers carved into the guts of the Mahakam Mountains, with walls plated in pure gold, the ice palace of Pont Vanis, adorned with stained-frost windows - yet none of these made such an impression on me as did the rightly-famed Zerrikania.<br><br>Yet while I was traversing the Fiery Mountains, I feared disappointment awaited me on the other side. I had heard many a fantastic tale about Zerrikania - about its trackless sands, burnt white by the sun, its golden-scaled dragons, weaving their nests amidst the dunes, its hunch-backed horses able to survive weeks without even a swallow of water - yet none seemed to me at all plausible. I was sure all these sensations were but the figments of some bard’s overactive imagination.<br><br>I know this will be as hard for you to believe, dear reader, as it once was for me - but all of the unbelievable tales are true. Not only that - during my many months of travel I came across wonders far surpassing those any prior travelogues mentioned. I saw temples dedicated to the worship of dragons. I heard their voice, almost human, but reverberating with a thousand echoes. I met warrior maids clad in leopard skins, tattooed from head to foot and giving no ground to witchers in mastery of the blade. I saw mages who channeled Power from fire. I saw seemingly harmless flies whose solitary bite would make a man fall into a deep slumber, never to awake save to die. In short, Zerrikania is a land where the fantastic is normal, and the impossible occurs daily…

   1060314|f74f0f79||Gustav, I’ve got something to ask of you. I've come into the possession of quite the stash of valuables. Don't ask how - modesty prevents me from trumpeting the heroic deeds I performed in the fight for our beloved fatherland. At any rate there's so damned much of it that there's no way in any hell I'll carry it back on my own, so I’ve put everything in a chest and buried it on the beach, at the base of the cliff with the two burned-out huts on it. You know, we'd go crayfish hunting there, remember?<br><br>So here's what you’ve got to do: grab a wheelbarrow, throw a shovel in it and take it to the beach - but make sure no one sees you. We'll load the treasure and sell it all in Vizima - and split the earnings fifty-fifty, like family should.<br><br>See you later. And remember - not a word to anyone!<br><br>Johenn

   1077091|f9d97cae||Those were the days. You'd smuggle a few bottles of hooch into Oxenfurt, hang out near the dormitories selling it to students, you'd come away with a hefty sack of coin and they'd have their spirits fortified for study. Then along came Radovid, shut down the university, chased the students off and put up ballistae on the riverbank to shoot everything floating the Pontar, swans included.<br><br>But there hasn't been a dark-cloud yet that didn't have a silver lining. Yesterday I saw our brave soldiers sink a merchant vessel. Went straight to the bottom along with its entire crew - and its cargo. A shame about the men - but it would also be a shame if all those goods went to waste. So me and Martin will fish them out, dry them off and then sell them - and maybe at last I'll have something to put in my pot.

I understand it's an honor to die in battle – but that weren't no battle. 'Twas a a slaughter! He exiled us, the bloated walrus, the siren and troll-spawned miscreant… And so off we went, but not empty-handed. Since he weren't using his ancestral horn to sound no retreat anyways, not even when his shield bearers were dying like flies, well, we took it off his hands. Kjarre took the horn with him and went north, into the fjords, where pirates and smugglers cast anchor atimes – says maybe they'll buy it off us… and then Mathios will never find it. Good. He didn't say a word in our defense when Holger was driving us off, so let him go out in a blaze of shame and disgrace.

The witch hunters prey on human poverty and pay informants well, but it is not fitting to condemn our dead to eternal wandering. If needs be, I will take it all on myself. Claim responsibility. I'd rather die than carry on my conscience dead souls who will never know comfort.<br><br>Bolko, Ealdorman of Midcopse

Gaining mastery of the keep should not present much of a problem, for we have heard only a handful of witchers remain in residence there. Therefore you must make haste: a 50 orens reward awaits you for every mutant head you sever.<br><br>Once we have taken the witchers' secrets, we must separate, in order not to attract attention.

    459339|fced51c0||I, Kjarre, son of Knut, have twice disgraced myself. First by running from the field of battle out of fear of dying. The shield I abandoned then rests on the bottom of that marsh, and there it will stay until Ragh nar Roog, as testimony of my cowardice. The second time was when Orn Two Heads convinced me to help him steal Holger Blackhand’s horn. Orn thought I’d sell the horn to smugglers, but I won’t. If I’m to live like a thief and a bandit, I prefer not to live at all. The one thing I can do to regain my honor is to return the horn to where it belongs, to its ancestral home. Mathios, who Holger charged with getting the horn back, has family near these cliffs. I hope he’ll come here for the equinox festival. Then I’ll be able to give him back the stolen horn and ask for him to vouch for me with the jarl. That’s all the hope I have left.
