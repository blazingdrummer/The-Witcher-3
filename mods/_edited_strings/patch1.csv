   1185723|420aa048||It is seven years today since we last saw Syanna and Anarietta. The spell is really starting to decay now -- and some of the residents of this land are beginning to go mad. The Wolf murdered Little Red Riding Hood and the Hunter, the Witch roasted Tom Thumb alive along with the Seven Hengforsians, and pixies attack anyone who comes near. We sought shelter in the clouds, but the Giant drove us away. Our last resort is the ship of King Thrushbeard. We are planning to wait the worst of it out in the middle of the lake.

   1185303|9a5471ae||12 September 1121<br>I’ve received confirmation Jerome has arrived and is staying at Fort Ussar. I am so giddy with anticipation I cannot continue my work. Yet I must try to calm myself and see through my plan.<br><br>13 September 1121<br>He arrived quite unexpectedly, right after dusk! He has changed a great deal – he is thin, wiry, all covered in scars. He was, of course, furious I brought him here under false pretexts, but what choice did I have? One day he will be a father himself and then he will understand what drives me.<br><br>I opened a portal in my study and brought Jerome to my lab. In doing so I exhausted my activation crystal, but luckily I have a spare. I gave the lad some time to think things over, for I’d rather do all this with his willing participation. Meanwhile I shall prepare the apparatus.

   1185301|a3c0d60d||The witcher I summoned reached Ussar on the 12th of September. He made a favorable impression. I had expected a cold killer, yet found myself speaking with someone who could easily be mistaken for a normal man – if not for his expansive knowledge concerning the habits of monsters, the two swords on his back and the griffin-head medallion on his chest. Jerome, as he was called, asked me a great many questions about the beast seen near Mont Crane castle. Based on my responses he concluded the monster in question was a leshen.<br><br>During our next conversation the witcher expressed his astonishment at being offered such a high reward, and one paid in advance, before he even arrived in Toussaint. I had taken a liking to the fellow and wanted to be honest with him. Despite the vow I had sworn, I revealed his pay came entirely from a certain Moreau, a mage, who had decided to use this gift to thank our community for a warm welcome.<br><br>When Jerome heard the mage’s name, he first went pale, then flew into a rage. He shouted, and I quote: “Gonna give that old bastard a piece of my mind!”,  then ran to the stables, mounted his steed and rode off, leaving the greater part of his possessions behind. He was seen on the road to Mont Crane, but then disappeared, like a rock thrown in deep water. Master Moreau claims he never saw the witcher.

Even gotta write this letter on the back of a diagram.<br><br>But before I die, I wanna tell you one thing: you’re a madman and always have been. A cruel, cold-blooded murderer. I haven’t felt anything for you for a long time. Anything but hate. I’m done with you and I hope you pay for your crimes one day.<br><br>Jerome

   1185197|e76ad293||17 May 1243<br>Finally, a response to my notice! A witcher, big as a mountain and bearded as a dwarf.

But I had no other choice – I had to agree.<br><br>18 May 1243<br>The witcher claims the problems are caused by some subterranean monster. He searched the area and found an entrance to a complex of caves by a stream in the Marcescent Forest. He plans to enter through it tomorrow.<br><br>20 May 1243<br>The witcher hasn’t returned. Some elf from the city asked about him. Now that’s some nerve, giving our address to nonhumans!<br><br>27 May 1243<br>Enough of this! I’ll never hire a witcher again! It will soon be ten days since he took his retainer and disappeared. I plan to sell the things he left behind to recover at least a portion of my losses.

   1185219|0e4ecd61||Dear Bartolomé,<br><br>I have received your letter and am delighted you have found a solution to your problems. The witcher you described does indeed seem dangerous – and you yourself always told me they are all freaks and cold-hearted murderers.<br><br>Yet despite all that, I still think you should agree to his offer. If those diagrams truly do outline revolutionary new methods in armor smithing, not only will you be able to complete the contract Her Grace has given you, but you will also earn a great deal of glory for yourself. And that, I know, is what you value above all else.<br><br>Going to the bandits who dwell in the ruins of Arthach Palace for protection is a wise move. If the knights could not get the best of them, a witcher will also feel duly cowed in their presence. Shady miscreants of all types always respect each other. Still, be extra careful during that meeting. Bandits and witchers are not to be trusted.<br><br>Yours Truly,<br>Belinda de Launay
   1185218|83b92f8b||Letter to Bartolomé de Launay
   1185223|b520c182||Burned all my bridges. No returning possible – not after I committed murder and took those grandmaster diagrams. Probably already on my tail. Hope to finish the deal quick and start a new life in the south.<br><br>My time as a witcher is over.<br><br>Can’t trust de Launay, especially since he insisted we meet in a bandits’ den. Hid the diagrams in a cave which no ordinary man will be able to enter. If everything goes smooth, I’ll collect my coin, tell him the cache is in the Pits of Brume – then offer to escort him there for an additional fee.<br><br>If it doesn’t go smooth and someone finds these notes, know this. It was worth it. Worth killing my own, worth stealing, worth anything to escape from a miserable life on the Path.

   1185221|8d486f17||It all went off without a hitch. Bartolomé de Launay proved a poncy fool, just like I thought. Witcher fell right into our trap, too – put too much stock in his skills, thought he could handle anything. At first we acted like bored thugs, just picking our noses and waiting for our pay. When de Launay and the witcher finally came to terms, the witcher let slip he was hiding the rest of the diagrams in the Pits of Brume. Dangerous place, that, but maybe we’ll find some safe route to the witcher’s cache.<br><br>One bolt from the black took care of de Launay. Expected more trouble from the witcher, so we hit him with a couple – good thing, too, because he still had a good heap of life in him, though he couldn’t even get up off his belly. I let the lads check just how much pain a witcher can stomach. They’d earned a bit of recreation after the fine job they’d done. Then we grabbed the coin of de Launay and soon we’re off to the Pits of Brume to get those precious diagrams and sell for all we can.

   1183932|09c8ca1e||First Day of the Expedition<br>I, Conrad Veidt, shall do the impossible! In eighty days I shall traverse the entire continent – from Caravista to Lan Exeter! I spit upon danger and hold in the highest contempt all the small-minded folk who predict catastrophe and failure! I shall prove to my adversaries that betting against me was the greatest mistake of their lives – a mistake for which they shall pay dearly, and in Nilfgaardian florens!<br><br>Sixth Day of the Expedition<br>I am still in Beauclair. To keep to my pre-established plan, I should have passed the city by altogether, for I am already two days behind, but… blast it all! My rear’s about to fall off from bouncing on that infernal wagon bench! I’ve reached my limit of hard tack and dried pork. I’ve earned a bit of luxury, so it’s time to visit the famed Pheasantry!<br><br>Eighth Day of the Expedition<br>I made some new friends in the Pheasantry, kindred lovers of adventure all! They caught on at once to the idea behind my expedition and decided to join me. Tomorrow, we embark, together. Yet Zuëzan, one of my new companions, suggested we leave the city at once and pitch a camp outside Beauclair – there we shall be able to conduct a thorough inspection of my supplies and prepare for the journey onward.<br><br>Eighth Day of the Expedition (Evening)<br>We have made our provisory bivouac. Everything was examined, my funds counted to the last copper. Zuëzan loaded everything on to a wagon and prepared the horses. I now sit by the fire, drinking Est Est and enjoying an evening of relaxation. Life is beautiful.

   1186969|d6cbc452||Brother,<br><br>Enough of this hesitation, this fretting, these feelings of guilt! Liam Coronata pays you practically nothing, and you’ve got a family to feed! So do as I say. Load up a cart with barrels of that new spiced wine and in the night, quiet as a mouse, haul it away from the estate. Head northwest, and when you cross the stream, you’ll find men waiting for you. Give them the barrels. They must be desperate to get this wine, because merely as down payment they’ve handed me a pleasantly heavy pouch… Just be careful, because a pair of those vile rock trolls hunt in the Blessure Valley. How’d trolls end up there, you ask? They were imported! For the tourney, for knights to battle for the crowd’s amusement. Thing is, they fled the transport and began slaughtering their way across the land.<br><br>P.S. Hide the share of the down payment I’ve sent, because if someone finds you with that kind of coin, they’ll start asking questions and our business will end quicker than it began.<br><br>P.P.S.

Since that last caravan we robbed, the one carrying a transport of fatback for workers at the quarry – we’ve had nothing, zero, zip! Luckily we ate our fill after that, gained a slight paunch to hold us through hard times… But if those times last much longer, we’ll have eaten more supplies here than we’ve looted! And everybody thinks being a bandit’s nothing but wine, wenches and merry-making! Should’ve listened to mama and finished school, or at least started it… <br><br>Tomorrow we head back to Mont Crane.

Things had already relaxed a bit in the swamps, because a good number of our men went off on assignment, but our hanse’s so bum-hugging huge the ruins of Palace Arthach still look like a bleeding bazaar. A man can’t even empty his bowels in privacy. To top it all, my bones ache to high heavens from this humidity and even wenches can’t warm me up properly.

Regular bloody bunch of literati. Should take to practicing swordplay or hunting, instead of becoming diarists. I keep a log, that’s enough for the whole lot of us. I’ll whip one or two of the harlotsbroods, wipe my derrière with their diaries and maybe the rest will get down to some honest banditry.

He tipped off his Black-plated buds at the embassy, I’m sure of it! We still slaughtered the lot of them, of course, but lost a few good lads of our own. Since Quayle means to diddle our derrières, let’s diddle Quayle. Grab him, scorch his heels and find out where he’s hid his share of the previous raid.

   1194392|26f47267||1st Day of the Month of Birke<br>The very first day, and I already regret agreeing to participate in this expedition. The journey itself will take eight weeks! Besides, I do not believe anyone from Isabelle Duchamp’s lost expedition remains alive. It has been years! Professor Ivor has taken a hearty supply of egg salad sandwiches with him for the road…<br><br>[a few stages are glued together by some sticky substance – probably mayonnaise]<br><br>14th day of the Month of Blathe<br>We have arrived! Professor Ivor gave the order to pitch camp near the ruins of Termes – the place where the missing group led by Professor Duchamp was supposed to carry out its excavations. Then we drank two bottles of wine and went to sleep.<br><br>16th Day of the Month of Blathe<br>The Termes Palace Ruins… the very thought of them sends shivers down my spine. Nevertheless, I believe we should begin our search in the ruins themselves. Yet the Professor keeps beating around the bush and spends most of his time curled up with a bottle. My suggestion to head deeper into the woods and look for signs of the expedition was shrugged off with a comment about my impertinence and an accusation of trying to take over leadership of the expedition.<br><br>18th Day of the Month of Blathe<br>The professor has perished. He departed yesterday morning and had not returned to camp by evening. We shall soon set out to look for him. Perhaps that drunkard finally dared visit the ruins?
   1194399|938378dc||As per your orders, Filibert, we joined Conrad Veidt’s “expedition.” A truly dense fool, that one. Set out from Caravista meaning to reach Lan Exeter on his own – and best part is, he wasn’t going to do any trading along the way! Said he’d made a bet with some pals that he could reach his goal in less than eighty days.<br><br>His wagon was chock full of supplies, along with an altogether weighty trunk of Nilfgaardian florens attached to the coach box. We drank and ate all night at the Pheasantry, on his coin. I’ve still got heartburn. Didn’t hesitate a moment before agreeing to let us join him on his journey. Our suggestion to pitch camp outside the city didn’t raise the slightest suspicion. Near finished the job without even getting our hands dirty, but alas… Zuëzan swung the hammer a bit too weakly, skull didn’t crack at once, and even though that cretin was drunk as a lord, he howled bloody murder and spooked the horses. To make things worse, they were already harnessed, so they dragged the wagon straight into the lake.<br><br>We’re eager to get the blazes out of here quick as possible, because this place is crawling with those bleeding knights errant and Ducal Guardsmen, but as if out of spite, the wagon’s got stuck in the mud… [a large ink blot renders the rest of the report illegible]

   1194396|56e2c582||If our fearless leader Starling Straggen’s going to write everything down in his notebook, why, then I’ll do the same! And I’ve plenty to write about, for the way we pillaged and plundered the Silver Salamander till it looked a pile of dank diarrhea was positively epic! Whole hanse had been fixing for ages to make a jaunt over to that tavern. For how long can you sit twiddling your thumbs at a place as foul as the ruins of Arthach? Water up to our ankles, fungus everywhere and the wind blowing so fierce our bums pucker. Why the dead-dong-diddle stick around? So we didn’t! We got our doodoo together and went to work! Hit them so hard, before they figured out what was going on, half of them had already been hacked apart! It was over in a flash. In fact, we got so carried away, not a living soul was to be seen when we were through, though it seems a few managed to scatter into the woods, including that blasted Nilfgaardian owner, but we’ll see to tracking down survivors later. Meanwhile, we’ll drink a bit, sing a bit, and then head out for a good hunt… So, there you go, my memoirs, signed me, vice-head of the hanse, Speedy Eugene.

   1194261|d43ef608||This hanse’s mighty odd. All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…

   1190171|6afb499d||Orders for Edgar Ciseaudoigts
   1190170|a39e102a||Dear Martina Crisca,<br><br>Congratulations on being promoted to the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian. I’m sure you’ll quickly become one of that institution’s premier scholars! Yet before you set off for Nilfgaard, I, old Victor Monnart, would like to ask you for a small favor. You know my sons, you played together as children – so you know how hard it is to coax them to get along. I feel in my bones it will soon come time for me to leave this vale of tears, yet I shall go with a heavy heart knowing Auguste, Hugo and Lucien will go at each other’s throats as soon as I pass. Thus I have dismantled my famed still into three parts and ask you, my darling Martina, to hide them from my sons. Perhaps searching together for the missing pieces of a machine which will give them wealth will bind them together and forever put an end to these foolish quarrels. In exchange for your trouble, I have included a modest pouch of coin. I wish you good luck!<br><br>Your Devoted Servant,<br>Victor Monnart
   1190169|6d1b9322||Letter to Martina Crisca
   1190168|5a9a830e||[Fragment of a journal soiled with blood and spinal fluid]<br><br>It portended to be just another day as a clerk at the Ducal Treasury. Start the morning with baguette and camembert, then shuffle some parchments and head for home before dusk. Today, however, the normal order of things was disturbed – dramatically. I came across a highly interesting note in the archives. And, along with it, a key. The key is the more interesting find, because according to what I could decipher from the dust-covered scribblings on the note, it opens a chest full of gold coins! But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br><br>While doing some routine straightening of the files, I found a report outlining procedures for the reform of Bastoy Prison – orders straight from Duke Henri Gras. We all are aware how badly this experiment ended, for the ruins of that prison to this day frighten any potential “tourists” with their battered skeletons and legends about howling spirits of the murdered guards. Yet I did not know that hiding among the abandoned ruins there was a chest, and that its key was lying right under my nose! The chest supposedly contains crowns meant for the purchase of books and rations for the inmates of Bastoy. One of the clerks employed here at the time committed a sin of omission and sent the chest to the warden without the key. Yet perhaps that was for the best? The warden was impaled and the guards all skinned alive, meaning those degenerates would have also got their hands on the chest, had he received the key. As it is – might the chest still be there, unopened?<br><br>Folk say a curse has fallen on that place, a dark power brought down by the bestiality of the murders it beheld, but folk also say an Ofieri will become emperor of Nilfgaard and herald the end of the world, so there’s not much point giving any of such jabbering much credence.
   1190172|dd042e8f||To Edgar Ciseaudoigts:<br><br>I’m sending you one of those miscreant knights. This particular bloede skrekk attacked our lads near Fox Hollow, sent six of them – and one dog -- off to push daisies. I was about to hack him apart on the spot, then I thought: this harlotsbrood deserves a more thorough hacking than I can give! So use those famous scissors of yours and trim him of all protuberances and danglies, then cut out his innards and make origami. Just be sure to tie him up good before you get to work. Even with his hands tied, that maggoty mutt swung so hard, teeth came pouring out of Beulaf’s jaw like crowns spilling from a full pouch.<br>Loth
   1190151|cc4f8473||[Journal is covered in dried blood, only some of the latest entries are legible]<br><br>I don’t believe in coincidences. Believing in coincidences is a privilege the officer commanding the Imperial Embassy’s defense brigade cannot afford.<br><br>The caravan transporting wine purchased for the imperial court was attacked and robbed within the borders of the duchy. The barrels of wine themselves are extremely valuable, yet traveling with the caravan was the undersecretary responsible for returning the embassy’s unused operation wherewithal. In other words, florens allotted to spread goodwill will not return to the empire’s coffers – for they are now in the hands of bandits. How could I have allowed such an important transport to have gone out without appropriate security measures?! This will not go over well in the capital...<br><br>To top it all, those impertinent provincials from the Ducal Guard had the audacity to impute one of the embassy’s employees must have informed the bandits of the caravan’s itinerary and route. I’d sooner suspect it’s someone from the Guard. Though, perhaps not. Those idiots have trouble finding their own arses, even with the help of a detailed map. The solution is clear – I shall personally see to escorting the next caravan safely beyond Toussaint’s borders… [rest illegible]

Who found the Violet Ruby of Aed Gynvael, me or her?<br><br>You must know the witcher has returned after all! The Ruby removed the barrier (as I held it would from the start!) and allowed him to explore the interior. Can you believe the witcher almost convinced that Duchamp to return to town to hire additional guards?! “We don’t know what dangers are in store for us.” Now there’s someone who knows how to pad his billable hours! Duchamp took to the idea, recalling the tale about the tomb being cursed. Yet I convinced the company not to put any stock in fairy tales. We must hurry, I said, for what if someone beats us to it and robs the elven treasury first? Because as you know, according to my translation the “most precious” can only mean one thing – the lost treasure of King Divethaf! Soon it shall be ours! (blood stains)<br><br>(later addendum partly obscured by blood stains)<br>The witcher was right. We should never have gone in there. That is an accursed place! I barely managed to escape, crawl out and take the Ruby. The portal has closed. I am safe, but the others… <br><br>

   1200878|15dd37e7||They told me if I walked the path of atonement, Lebioda would give me strength and show me the way to start a new life. They lied. I gave away everything I had, I did penance for all my sins, I compensated those I had wronged - and what? Nothing. I feel empty, bereft. Let devils take Lebioda and all his followers!
   1200877|14285f48||I was a foul sinner, yet in Lebioda I found grace. I was unhappy, yet in Lebioda I found joie de vivre. I wasted away my life on pleasures of the flesh, laziness and revelry, yet in Lebioda I found a new calling. Here, in the Lake of Cleansing, I leave behind what binds me to my past sins. Let it remain here forever and always.
   1200876|127386a9||Thanks be unto Thee, Great Lebioda, for Thy help, for Thy mercy, for Thy warmness of heart - for it has allowed me to walk the path of redemption and atone for my sins. May Thy name be praised for all eternity!<br><br>Pagodar

For the Imperial Dramatic Academy examinations, I shall reenact Elsa de Longpré’s most famous role! Her final performance!  The one where she died, on stage! The most perfect actorly act that has ever been acted! Then they will be forced to advance me!<br><Br>1st of Feainn<br>This role is... too difficult. My teacher is still not pleased. Perhaps I simply lack the talent… It is hard to measure up to Elsa’s legend...<br><Br>5th of Feainn<br>Yes! Now I know what I was missing. I must FEEL the role, recreate the entire evening at the amphitheater. With candles, wine, the works! Just like Elsa once did! The aura of that place might provide the help I need – they say Elsa spent nearly her entire life there. Folk claim the amphitheater’s haunted and that is why no more plays are performed there. Apparently, everyone who has tried to act out Elsa’s scene on that amphitheater’s stage has died in mysterious circumstances. Old wives’ tales. Even if it is haunted, I believe Elsa’s spirit will give me its blessing!<br><br>7th of Feainn<br>Tonight, I set out! I have prepared candles and acquired two bottles of the very same wine Elsa drank right before her death! I will rehearse and rehearse and rehearse! Until at last I feel, I believe, indeed, I AM Elsa!<br><br>[fragment of a script, highlighted in red ink]<br><br>The day now dies. It collapses into itself, as does my soul… Darkness like a stifling vapor shall soon swallow me. No! Now I am at last ready to renew the memory of ghosts in my heart.<br><br>I shall light the candles.<br><br>Let the first flicker for the lad, a mere child, who was smitten and perished on the field of battle at high noon without a murmur.<br>Let now the second flicker for he who wished to fetch me a jewel from the bottom of the well, and never surfaced to see the light of this world again.<br>Let the third flicker for the husband – handsome as a  statue, cold as a stone! – who left me alone and in darkness departed. Anonymously he died, in the woods, he perished.<br>Let the fourth flicker for he who loved so beautifully, so heatedly delighted and in this fire was consumed.<br>Let the fifth flicker for you, my beloved, my faithful companion, my hapless husband! Wracked by disease! You lie in the earth most shallowly of all.<br>All candles now flicker.<br>So lovely, so white.<br>Men, boys, husbands – mine, all! I love you to the last.<br><br>Now behold the wine. I drink it and with it sanctify your memory.

   1202579|e5f3f3e4||I took the wife out to dine the other night. It was our fourteenth anniversary and we wanted to celebrate it suitably, which is why we selected the Cockatrice Inn. The food that we were served was so foul, my wife vomited it all out while still at the inn, and I did the same when we reached home. I have no idea what we were served, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it had been the corpse of a raftsman fished out of the river. One that had drowned quite some time ago, for an odor that potent does not develop overnight. They tried to convince us we were eating fresh crayfish.

Everywhere you turn, there's a jiggling rear end poking out from behind a tree, and there's no way to explain this to an impressionable child.

She won't look you in the eye, but animals take to her like bees to honey. My tomcat is old and had been getting rather sickly.

   1198802|051fb384||The most important aspect of raising human livestock is to provide the herd with conditions that, on the one hand, guarantee their survival, but, on the other hand, do not extend too far beyond the minimum needed for that survival. It should be borne in mind that people are creatures bestowed with great intelligence, or rather cunning and instincts that allow them to gain as much as possible from their environment. In terms of husbandry, this means humans will always try to obtain more than we give them. It is recommended, therefore, to provide each individual with a place to sleep, a meal twice a day and permanent access to water. These conditions, which might seem overly luxurious to some, ensure the optimal production of high quality hemoglobin (more details on diet in later chapters). Also essential is access to air, without which humans die within minutes.<br><br>There is no need to be concerned about the ability for human livestock to multiply in the conditions described above. If they are ensured a minimal existence and male and females are mixed, they will copulate irrespective of whether they are in captivity or not.<br><br>It is worth mentioning here that there is a school of thought that suggests treating human livestock with greater freedom and care, including providing them with better quality fodder and a certain degree of freedom. This allegedly ensures a greater amount of favorable elements in the blood and makes it tastier, however, it is worth mentioning that this method of husbandry is much more difficult and requires emotional bonding techniques, which will be discussed in the following chapters.

The witcher Geralt then, in the words of Vasilly S., “made quick work of the band, not sparing a one,” said individuals not having been spared taken to include Ernest, wanted for some time in Toussaint for rape (three counts) and murder (fifteen counts).<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 25% to take into account swordplay making use of more than one weapon and immediate payment in species.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Casteldaccia vineyard – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the ruins of the castle atop Mont Crane. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Filibert Fourfingers, wanted by writ of law in Belhaven, Metinna and Nazair, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 30% to take into account resort fees and immediate payment in species.

Naturally, by "the entire world," I in fact mean the areas that have entered man’s jurisdiction – Toussaint’s architecture obviously could not hold a candle to the wonders of Dol Blathanna. That is in no way meant to detract from the glory of the ruins of Termes, the old amphitheater or Arthach, the one-time summer residence to Toussaint's kings. More than any of these, however, it is the palace which captures one’s eye with its… [torn page]<br><br>…spacious terraces seemingly enclosed by openwork exedras with rows of intricate tracery and pinnacles crowned with spiked crockets. One may admire them through legions of ogival windows, the traceries of which are often decorated with the floral ornaments so typical for the culture of the Aen Seidhe. This style is especially prominent in its buttresses and niches.

Who secured the import of such tomes as <i>The Lives of the Prophets</i>, <i>De Haemorrhoidibus</i>, <i>The Art of Midwifery for Maidens</i> and many others? The palace library has me to thank for <i>The Storehouse of All Knowledge Needed for a Merry and Satisfied Life</i> and other rare tomes, such as <i>Speculum Aureum</i> and <i>De Larvis Scenicis Et Figuris Camicis</i>.

The Parties decide whether the duel ends when first blood has been drawn or when one of the Parties surrenders<br>(let it be remembered that in Toussaint, by order of Her Enlightened Highness, duels fought till last blood are punished by immediate imprisonment).<br>3. The Challenged Party selects the weapons for the duel. The Challenger is obliged to accept the choice of the Challenged Party.<br>4. The Parties duel according to the rules agreed upon. The Seconds ensure proper course of the duel.<br>5. When the duel is over, the Seconds announce the winner and the loser.<br><br>NOTE: It is strictly forbidden to put forth any claims (blood revenge included) based upon defeat in the duel. The duel is commonly regarded as an instance putting a definite end to the dispute.

The Gorgon Foothills and the slopes of Mont Crane are places where I shall be able to find dozens of exploration sites. The endless caverns carved out of that volcanic rock will assure me material to study for months to come!<br><br>17 Feainn<br>Incredible. I cannot find a single spot fit for study. The matter should be simple, for tuff is usually uninhabited, but all these grottos are either full of monstrosities or have been bought up by copper-pinching wine merchants scheming to fill every cave with their hideous barrels! Blast, I must find a cicerone, a local guide of some sort who will show me to some completely unoccupied cavern!<br><br>20 Feainn<br>A certain Luq Veunèque whom I encountered in San Sebastian has enticed me with promises of a fabulous cave ("you won’t regret it, Master Gerek!"), in which there are no greedy grape hoarders nor any monsters. Tomorrow we shall set out to the Blessure Forest, but before embarking I invited my guide to a supper at the Pheasantry – we will be spending several days together, after all, and I’d like to get to know him better. Luq turned out to be a picky gentleman. The chef de cuisine served us veal cutlets in garlic sauce and Gessenese bean soup. Luq, however, asked for pancakes and red wine, making excuses about an inborn distaste for garlic. He also didn’t touch the silver cutlery, explaining something about an allergy and making use of his own wooden set instead. Despite these oddities, he made for quite interesting company and we chatted over a bottle (bottles, to be precise) of wine until late in the night. Something tells me there will soon be much talk of the Votty Gerek - Luq Veunèque duo in the world of speleologists!

   1209954|ac5f1303||Dear Geralt,<br><br>If you are reading these words, it means I am already far beyond the borders of Toussaint and you have found my Mutagenerator. (Of course, you may dub this instrument however you like, perhaps something more fitting to your taste or better reflecting its function, for I have no doubt your knowledge on the subject of mutagens is far more profound and thorough than mine!)<br><br>I have been working on this device in my spare time, but now it is finished and I am convinced – as convinced as an inventor can be before his invention has been used as intended – of the usefulness of this apparatus.<br><br>You are surely wondering what function it is meant to serve. As the name indicates, the Mutagenerator generates mutagens. It operates by absorbing electromagical energy waves from bodies (in this case, the bodies of the monsters and evil-doers you kill) – and when it has absorbed enough so as to be charged a critical amount, the Mutagenerator changes the stored energy into a Greater Mutagen – which, I suspect, you will make good use of. <br><br>As you surely understand, I am an amateur engineer, which is why you must forgive the lack of an ability for you to direct this operation. Which mutagen emerges as a result is determined at random, meaning chance will decide if it is a Green, Red or Blue Mutagen. Chance – yet I have noted the colors tend to alternate, by and large.<br>I trust you shall find my gift useful.<br><br>Your dearly devoted friend,<br> Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy<br><br>P.S. You might be wondering why  I decided to toss the Mutagenerator into your home instead of simply handing it to you in person. Well, you must know I did it out of modesty. Believe it or not. <br>Take care, Geralt – and may my gift serve you well.

Why would they? That whole Ogzenfurt is in a land far, far away, up North. That’s what we planned, I’ll cool up here a while and be back some time before winter, things should have calmed down, then. What’s key is for folk in the village keep their mouths shut tight. They do that, how will anyone find out he even made it to Fox Hollow? He could’ve been killed by vandaguilders along the way, could he not? Just go tell Séverin to pour quicklime down that hole and drop in a torch, just in case. Quicklime, that’ll do the trick, turn both that smarty-trousers’ body and those old skeletons into molten sludge in a snap. For who the bumblazes knows when the next scholar will show?

   1209965|1e708c97||In the sun-drenched duchy of Toussaint, near the Coronata vineyard, lay the estate of Baronet Hubert Balaste, an honorable knight in the service of Duchess Ademarta. Hubert served as a knight errant for many years and vows were his greatest delight. He swore to do things so grand they curdled blood of other knights. The duchess finally recognized his courage and not only awarded him with an honorary title, but also granted him land. Hubert thus had a place of his own on which to settle down and wait till his time came with dignity. He could find himself a wife and sire descendants as befits every self-respecting hero.<br><br>Unfortunately, once he had lain down his sword and shield, Baronet Balaste began to seek other diversions. And so he indulged in games of card and dice – and at times even bet on dog fights. Then, one day, when fortune abandoned him, he decided to bet not one or two gold pouches, but in fact his family’s entire estate. And he lost. Everything. To add to this already unhappy state of affairs, Hubert Balaste, who was not one to take defeat lightly, flew into a fit of blind passion, donned his armor and enlisted at once. Fortune alas smiled no more favorably upon him at war than it did at play, and an arrow found its way to Hubert’s leg. Then he died of gangrene.

   1209238|eabdc862||On Sound Waves: Bats and Shaelmaars
   1209237|394b22ea||Few know that sound is in fact not just a noise, but a wave - just like the waves of a sea striking against the shore. And just like them, sound waves strike everything in their path, which causes them to break. This particular property of sound is used by some species of animals and monsters as they carry out a kind of terrain mapping using their sense of hearing. Bats, which produce a specific sound to conduct echolocation based on how this sound's waves bounce off potential obstacles, make for a good example of this. Curiously, shaelmaars – mighty, though completely blind monsters – have developed a similar mechanism. They are able to locate their opponents by sensing the vibration of even the faintest sound wave.
   1209223|4ffd7d0a||If you take a fleder and magnify all of its most primitive traits, you will get a protofleder. This beast, the fleder's distant ancestor, arrived here from a parallel sphere centuries past, yet, unlike the fleder, has remained untouched by any post-Conjunction evolutionary processes. In our time protofleders are extremely rare, the more suitably adapted fleders having taken over their niche in our biosphere.<br><br> Protofleders are thus lesser vampires. Their massive, wide jaws constitute their main weapons, their sharp claws coming in a close second.<br><br>Similarly to their more developed cousins, protofleders rely on their instincts rather than intelligence and are quite sensitive to the scent of blood. All the usual means of fighting vampires, such as vampire oil, Black Blood, and silver weapons, apply to them as well.
   1209222|a5f195b5||In the course of my research into bruxae, I have stumbled upon certain inconsistencies that in no way correspond with what we already know about these dangerous vampires. My investigations have revealed that these seemingly erroneous accounts were in fact describing an alp, not a bruxa! It is an extraordinary discovery, a true milestone in the classification of these monsters.<br><br>Even though legends tell of these vampires turning into pitch black hounds or venomous toads, personally, I do not believe an alp is capable of such polymorphy. However, it is almost certain that, similarly to a bruxa, an alp may transform itself into a beautiful woman. This ability allows the species to blend seamlessly into crowds. To think that I may have passed such a monster completely unawares – fascinating!<br><br>One of the fundamental differences between alps and bruxae is their fighting style when in the form of a vampire. Alps also possess the ability to turn into fog, which allow them to move noiselessly and attack by surprise. Most likely this is the root of the name common folk have given them: "fleetlings."

His main line of reasoning was an absurd and completely off the mark parallel drawn between the developmental cycles of the slyzard and pieris brassicae, also known as the cabbage butterfly. “A slyzard” – claimed the author – “is nothing but a fully mature wyvern that has developed fire glands.”<br><br>Utter rubbish!

   1209053|3e6cfad9||I once quarreled with a man who insisted no substantial differences separate spriggans and leshens. The knave riled me greatly, for he had seen nearly nothing of life, yet spoke with the haughtiness of a witcher or other such professional for whom monsters are his stock and trade. One evening at the inn, his blather soured my beer such that I decided to prove to him a spriggan resembles a leshen only in the most superficial ways.<br><br>I thus took him deep into a wild wood and together we walked for upwards of two hours. I recalled having spied a spriggan there a year earlier and had heard the beasts are not fond of changing their place of dwelling. During my previous encounter, I had taken great fright at once and run off as fast as my legs would carry me. Later, I found out that, if undisturbed, a spriggan will rarely attack a human. Unfortunately, during my second encounter I learned the hard way that noise disturbs them. Greatly. When my acquaintance began engaging in loud mockery and cruel ribbing, chortling in raucous laughter all the while, a monster suddenly sprouted out of the ground before our very feet.<br><br>I could take no satisfaction in being proved correct, for the spriggan knocked my unfortunate fool of a colleague to the ground in one powerful blow and then trod him till his innards squirted out of every possible opening. I tried to escape, but it was as if my legs had planted roots in the ground. Meanwhile, the spriggan brought silence to the wood, shot me a stare and then sauntered off, as if nothing had happened.<br><br>That was, I pray, my last encounter with a spriggan and the last time I shall have to explain to anyone why those monsters are different from leshens.<br>
   1209052|7b1a419e||Bruxae are an incarnation of man’s worst fears. They resemble women or nymphs, so they can blend into the crowd unnoticeably, even though in truth they are bloodsuckers – ruthless vampires savoring human blood, for whom man is nothing but a toy. There is no beast more dreadful than one that can disguise as one of us - a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But there is another reason why bruxae chill our blood - this female creature kindles man's hidden fear of sexuality and of being dominated by a woman.

I think I have reached the point where observation is no longer enough to bring satisfying results.

I was also able to discover archespores are particularly sensitive to fire, which may prove a useful piece of information regarding how to neutralize them if necessary.<br><br>Day 6<br><br>I have made up my mind.

   1208923|700275b1||Once upon a time, in a small mound near the Vermentino vineyard, there lived a wight named Franconi. Amiable by nature, he spent his days in the mound, cooking various kinds of soups. Not that he was particularly fond of soups – it was his beloved pet, a barghest named Spikey, that slurped them up greedily. And so they sat there, side by side, Franconi the Wight and Spikey the Barghest, cooking soups made of decaying bones, withered weeds and, if they managed to swipe some metal, nails, their favorite delicacy.<br><br>One day Franconi heard two gravediggers talk about a certain man of wealth who kept various kinds of cheese in his cellar. A cheese soup sounded like a delectable treat to Franconi, so he snuck into the noble’s cellar and stole the biggest cheese wheel there was. When he got home, Franconi started slowly melting the cheese in his favorite pot. The stench was so awful Spikey ran off and refused to go back to the mound. To add to the already terrible state of things, the smell of cheese permeated everything, so Spikey and Franconi had to pack their things and move.<br><br>The moral of the story is simple. If you are cooking a cheese soup, make sure the cheese you choose is not blue.

   1208926|4193658a||Fleders are a vile and unsophisticated variety of a vampire. They are unable to run properly, cannot bear direct sunlight and are generally none too wise. Some fleders hunt alone, whereas others prefer to attack in groups. Perhaps it is a matter of instinct – having sensed blood, they assess the size of the victim and, if necessary, summon their kin. The only strong suit of these leeches is their ability to leap towards a potential victim.<br><br>Fighting a fleder is no different than fighting any other kind of bloodsucker. Apart from the obvious means, such as garlic, buckthorn, and sunlight, a hunter should stock up on silver. A lit torch may prove helpful as well.

My dearest love, Alige Elise, dwells with her family at an estate snuggled in a valley so deep that, between September and March, the sun is continually hidden behind the abutting slopes. All the residents of this settlement must live in constant twilight and darkness for these long months. Yet soon, this perennial torture will be but a dark memory! My invention is brilliant in its simplicity. Atop one of the nearby mountains, I shall install a system of mirrors to reflect the rays of the sun towards her manor! That’s it! Haha! It was worth it, all those long nights spent at the Imperial Academy Library during my studies, perfecting my skills in arithmetic and alchemy!<br><br>I would like to test my discovery today, but father keeps shouting that my “contraption” will only attract a few feeble-minded magpies to doodoo all over our abode, or, even worse, bring in a flock of harpies – but he’s always got a problem with everything! I’ll wait until he leaves for town, then set up my mirrors in a flash!

The transformations they experience during the Trial of the Grasses, which are widely considered to be irreversible, cause witchers to become infertile, while significantly increasing their physical strength and sharpening their senses. The processes also deprive witchers of emotions and human reflexes.<br><br>Although information about the Trial of the Grasses and other transformations to which young adepts of the witcher craft are subjected is strictly protected by master witchers and witcher sorcerers, Ludovic Cèlestin of Ban Ard claims the albumen of gray scolopendromorphs, the strain of giant centipede more commonly known as Pale Widows, constituted the basis of witcher mutagens. However, all research confirming this theory has been lost (…).

Being exiled from the beautiful deserts and steppes of Ofier to this hideous green country, where all the scents and flavors are so intense they make me sick, fills my heart with sorrow and regret.<br><br>My only comfort seems to be a small colony of scolopendros (or, more scientifically speaking – scolopendromorphs), here referred to as giant centipedes, living in the vicinity of my hut. These wonderful creatures, the sight of which reminds me of home, have most likely chosen this area to settle in because of the presence of shaelmaars, whose droppings constitute the food of smaller animals, which, in turn, are consumed by scolopendros. Sometimes I sneak up on them when they are feeding and admire their hooked limbs, mandibles so sturdy they seem made of iron, and chitinous thoraces shiny enough to let one to gaze upon one's reflection…

Though they maintain a facade of independence and altruism, the knights errant of Toussaint of our day are paid, and by the Duchess herself! So I ask – is that noble? Is that dignified?! Should a knight, a nobleman after all, receive payment for his heroic deeds?! Is he but a mercenary or, pardon my Nazairi, a ploughing witcher? Shouldn’t the tears of joy of a rescued damsel suffice as a reward? I simply cannot understand it! To paraphrase the weighty words of the wise Renè de Hospitalier – such fools, these Toussaintois.

Should white wine be one's beverage of choice, I wholeheartedly recommend the excellent offerings of two fiercely competing vineyards, Coronata and Vermentino. If one seeks Beauclair White, popular in the North, one should seek out the Castel Toricella vineyard, which produces and exports it. Unfortunately, a severe economic crisis led to the bankruptcy of several distinguished vineyards such as Corvo Bianco, known as Gwyn Cerbin in the Elder Speech (oh, their supreme Sepremento…!) and Tufo. Let us hope each and every one of them finds a passionate new owner who will restore them to their former glory…

   1208761|45fc611d||During a visit to the court of the king of Nazair, Waltharius the Brawny fell madly in love with the king's daughter, the beautiful Hiltgunt, who was already promised to a prince from Metinna. Waltharius, paying no heed to these politically-inspired marriage plans, captured the princess’ heart and together they ran off to Toussaint. The prince from Metinna, unable to let such an affront pass, followed the star-crossed lovers. Yet Waltharius was renowned for his courage and might and thus slew his adversary with ease. Then he and his beloved returned to his family estate at Dun Tynne.<br><br>To his dismay, it turned out his brother Vislavius had nearly led the estate to bankruptcy while Waltharius had been in Nazair. Waltharius threw his brother into the dungeon and, as befits a self-respecting nobleman, embarked on a knightly expedition. Unfortunately his young wife, Hiltgunt, tortured by her solitude, freed Vislavius and became his lover. When Waltharius returned and realized he had been cuckolded, he murdered them both in a fit of passion and despair. Then he sat down and wept and wept and wept…

Looking elsewhere, the nearby Zurbarrán castle offers the dry Castel de Neuf, whereas Nuragus and Sancerre, located in the northern parts of Toussaint, specialize in red wines and, jointly, produce and export the wine known in the North as Toussaint Red. Exquisite rosé wine could once be found at Casteldaccia, but ever since its owner tragically passed away, the vineyard has fallen into decay…

   1208693|0e7f3970||[notes written in blood on a scrap of fabric]<br><br>On this scrap rent from my own garment, using my own blood and a fragment of bone from some unknown creature, I write a summary of my sad tale, for I shall surely perish forthwith. Perhaps one day a bard shall happen upon it and compose from it a ballad to squeeze tears from the most pitiless miser.<br><br>Some time ago I spied a monster roaming in proximity to my estate. Upon further investigation, I learned it was a she-troll, descended from the Gorgon Foothills. I thus scraped together a few crowns and went to the camerlengo, to request he hire a knight errant to slay the monstrosity. Yet as I was making this journey, said she-troll sprang out of the bushes, knelt down by my horse and professed something in the garbled speech of trolls that I took to mean she had chosen me as her beau. Since it is most ill-bred to be rude to a lady, even a monstrous one, I declined her politely and was ready to be on my way when she tossed a sack over me, tucked me under her arm and carried me here, to this clearing. She locked me in a cage and stared at me for hours, sending creeping shivers down my spine… So now I slowly starve to death, for while she gives me clear water to drink, my only food is the soup that she-troll spends all day brewing, a foul concoction reeking of carrion and onion. I would rather perish than put that slurry to my lips…

For Our Prophet has written: “To shun the pleasures of the flesh and shirk from comfort is at times recommended, and to value one’s neighbor’s fortune above one’s own comfort is commendable.”<br><br>That is why we, the Eighth Day Flagellants, scourge ourselves and torment our flesh to ensure all folk of the world enjoy long and prosperous lives.

   1208563|fb48e6c0||Ussar Castle constitutes part of the series of fortifications constructed during the reign of Duke Roger the Reveler. Sadly, it turned out his master builders were as fond of the bottle as he, the result being structural flaws in the building’s foundations. The sloppily-placed stones proved unable to bear the weight of the walls and the castle collapsed. Many years later the ruins were reconstructed into a small fort to house knights protecting the high road, but currently it lies empty and abandoned.
   1208562|ad9e12c5||The slopes of Dun Tynne long lay barren. Potential entrepreneurs were scared off by the bloody legend of Waltharius the Burly and since the area had never produced wines worthy of historical mention anyways, they had little incentive to conquer this fear. The estate’s most recent owner, however - a nobleman named Roderick - decided to plant vines along the slopes stretching from the Blessure and Sansretour valleys up to the keep. As a precaution, he also planted olive groves, a much surer investment.
   1208561|e9e2d7c0||The de la Croix family never had much luck in business. Their grapevines fell victim to Duke Adam of Nazair’s attempts to regulate the flow of the Sansretour and their olive groves were devoured by a plague of armored scale insects. After this, they restored their old water mill, counting on the production of bread to be their ticket to success. And it nearly was - until they found out the hard way high concentrations of flour in restricted spaces can lead to powerful dust explosions.
   1208560|534502a1||The second most popularly cultivated plant in Toussaint – the first being the grapevine, of course – is the olive tree. It is mainly grown for its olives, which are pressed for their oil, but is also prized among woodcarvers. The unquestionably most cherished tree in the region, however, is the Beauclair oak, which is used in the making of wine barrels. And the most important place in Toussaint for the processing of this tree is the Rioux-Cannes woodcutters' outpost.
   1208567|6527f124||Once upon a time, the lord of Epicéa mounted his steed and vowed to complete a full circuit around the castle – riding atop its walls. Sadly, he did not fulfill his oath and instead plummeted to his doom after a few paces. Cunigunde, his beautiful daughter, swore that day she would only marry the man who could finish her father’s deed. Many a stripling lad lost his life attempting to fulfill that comely maid’s cruel condition. When finally one succeeded, he surveyed the carnage she had wrought and decided she was unworthy of his affections. Realizing with despair how despicably she had acted, Cunigunde threw herself from the castle walls, dying smashed against the rocks below like so many of her unfortunate suitors.
   1208566|f1c43e55||It is widely accepted that vampires came into our world during the Conjunction of the Spheres. They quickly spread across all the Continent, trying to adapt to their new situation. According to legend, one of them, Khagmar, settled in Toussaint. Grim tales are whispered about his deeds, but whether he truly even existed is hard to say. The tales do agree on one thing, however: Khagmar’s story is inextricably tied to the mysterious fortress known as Tesham Mutna.
   1208565|a6eb9597||Amadis de Trastamara obtained this property from Duchess Caroberta in recognition for his service to Toussaint. The ruler’s gift came with an unexpected barb, however, for the house turned out to be haunted and, even worse, deep in tax arrears. Trastamara consulted the druids of Caed Myrkvid about his case and was given the following advice: if you cannot reach a deal with the specter, let it be and call it a day.
   1208564|0947facc||Old Man Gelenser grew radishes. Yes, radishes. Not grapes, not olives, not even beets. As he himself put it: “Dadgummit, I can’t very well live on bread and wine alone, now can I?!” Old Man Gelenser did not found a radish empire. The history of his line is not filled with amazing legends. He lived, sired children, planted radishes and died. O Lebioda, give us all such a calm and simple life.
   1208571|715055d4||The experimental attempts to manage the waters of the Sansretour Marsh carried out by Duke Adam of Nazair did not prove very successful – to put it lightly. They flooded a great number of villages, private estates and even Arthach, an elven summer palace. These experiments were what gave the Sansretour Marsh its current shape and put half of Crane Isle permanently underwater. They also created an unpleasant bog to the north of the city where none can tread in true safety.
   1208570|bc31ae36||Work on the Temple of Lebioda in Beauclair was begun by the prophet’s most famed disciple, Plegmund. He convinced Duchess Caroberta to rebuild that area of the city and dig deep catacombs for the city’s wealthiest inhabitants. Those of less coin were to be buried in the new cemetery beside the temple. The poorest of the poor, however, had to continue to make do with the Orlémurs Cemetery, connected to the city by the Temple Gate, also known as the Gate of Lebioda.
   1208569|bc91171b||Toussaint’s mighty rivers are not the only route for getting wine out of the duchy. During the spring run-off, the Sansretour becomes very dangerous to navigate and local exporters turn to transport methods less likely to result in catastrophic loss. These merchants group together into caravans, hire guards and set out with their goods overland. Their favored destination? Metinna, whose capital is likewise named Metinna, leading some Toussaintois to joke their wine is medicine for that kingdom’s fabled lack of imagination.
   1208568|f3e02aad||Dear traveler, you have entered the territory of Dun Tynne, lands belonging to the nobly-born Sir Roderick. If you wish to pay him a visit, walk westward from here and you shall surely happen upon his castle. If, however, you seek a route to the Pittapatte river crossing, you should make your way north.

   1208559|c6f467aa||One of the best-preserved artifacts of the elven era, the Beauclair Palace was painstakingly restored and partially rebuilt by the famed Nilfgaardian architect Faramond. Master Faramond, a scholar and expert on nonhuman architecture, is considered the founder of the Neoelven School, of which the Beauclair Palace, home to the rulers of Toussaint, is the most characteristic example.

   1208407|334c83d2||The transmutation of bodies is one of the most difficult tasks any mage can undertake – indeed, only the true masters of the Art have ever accomplished it, and even they have only perfected one of its forms. This difficulty arises from psychophysical limitations, since a mage can only safely transform into an animal with which he is perfectly attuned. A famous example is that of Ulf Blackbeard, who dwelled for years in a cave with a bear in order to imbibe the life essence of that animal.

   1208405|3197ab33||Yarrow is, first and foremost, used for medicinal purposes. As mentioned above, when the leaves of this herb are placed against the flesh, they heal all kinds of trauma, wounds and sores. Brew it, and the resulting tincture treats the common cold, colic and loss of appetite. Yet in addition to their healing properties, the branches of the yarrow plant can be used for fortune telling. This method of divination might seem strange upon first glance, but is in truth simple and effective. It truly allows one to focus on the query at hand and gain an answer both accurate and satisfying.

Leave in a cool place for at least two hours. Boil the chanterelles till they are soft, but don’t make jam out of them – remember, al dente, you fool! Prepare the tagliatelle in the same way. If you make mush here, you might as well hang up your apron, for you’re no chef. Once the turkey’s taken on the bouquet’s fragrance, throw it in a pan with the heated olive oil. Pour in the wine – once it’s boiled off, toss in the pasta. Let it fry for a bit. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the noodles. Give it all a good peppering. Add two tablespoons of ricotta – mix thoroughly. Plate the dish and decorate with the arugula.

   1208389|3882c2eb||To be delivered personally to Damien de la Tour<br><br>Dear Commander,<br>We, the undersigned, turn to you with a polite request to provide protection to our humble settlement on Coopers’ Slope, for we live in fear of acts of rampage and destruction on the part of giants descending from Mount Gorgon. As recently as a week ago, one such giant attacked our cooper’s workshop, destroyed our yard, stole one of the barrels and put it on his head (as if donning a helm!). Heedless to our warnings that this contradicted the item‘s intended use and might lead to unpredictable side effects, it then fled towards the Sansretour River.

   1208423|be2b643f||My beloved Seraphine has a lover. I’m not going to rend my garments, curse the gods or swear vengeance. My Seraphine brims with so much life energy, it was inevitable some would spill over into other canals. It is now up to me to cut off those spillways, vanquish my rival and hope the walls I erect will prove sufficient to satisfy her vitality and give us a life of mutual exuberance… I have already forgiven her. Now I need but meet her beau and remove him from our life. <br><br>Yesterday I followed Seraphine. They hold their trysts at the Olive Grove – how romantic. When they met... Birds flew over the grove. A whole flock… Twittering and chirping. As if celebrating the lovers’ joy… and as if mocking me cruelly…  how symbolic.<br><br>I can see this romance drain my darling wife. Since she began seeing this… her lover, she has become anemic, eternally pale. She wanders the house at night aimlessly, blindly. She used to be so lively, so radiant, yet now she is listless, apathetic, resigned. I must gather my courage and end their relationship as soon as possible.<br><br>I, Christophe Dugarry, despise violence. I shall resolve the matter of my wife’s lover pragmatically. I have prepared a full sack of Nilfgaardian florens, one so heavy I can barely lift it. I shall wait for my Seraphine to return from the grove to our residence and then I shall catch him… and make him an offer he cannot refuse. Saint Lebioda, give me strength!

   1208420|8276e255||[Journal kept chaotically, dates missing, ink blots abound]<br><br>What on earth got into me?! Humming one of Master Dandelion’s ballads in front of Her Illustrious Grace?! Ugh, to fall into disfavor in such a foolish way… I, a young, ambitious politician with brilliant career prospects at the ducal court, now find myself exiled due to my own stupidity. I must find a way to plead the duchess’ forgiveness…<br><br>They say the emperor has offered the duquessa a very strange gift: a shaelmaar! The knights are to face off against it during the tourney. Now, were I to make a similar offering to Her Illustrious Grace...<br><br>Inconceivable! The gods have smiled on me! I ran into a witcher in Belhaven willing to help me catch a young shaelmaar. Naturally he demanded a fortune for his services, but I am ready to do anything to get myself out of the duchess’ black books. The witcher collected a down payment and set off for the Amell Mountains...<br><br>I’ve got it! Success! With an offering for Her Grace worthy of an emperor, I can at last return to the duchy and seek forgiveness! Now I need only find a way to transport the shaelmaar to Beauclair...<br><br>I gathered my entire retinue and together we embarked on the good ship Suzanne. With the current in our favor, we should be in the capital in a mere three days!<br><br>I feel like the hero of some elven tragedy. Just when it seems all is going perfectly, catastrophes fall from the sky and pummel me to the ground… The shaelmaar chewed through the deck, sank the ship and dug its way into the river bottom. I begged the captain to help me capture the monster in exchange for the rest of my fortune. As the witcher instructed, I will light incense made of rue and direct the smoke at the monster, which should calm it. The sailors can then capture it in their nets.<br><br>I am finished. The rue incense did not work. The shaelmaar flew into a rage and killed nearly everyone. True, the captain managed to escape, but I could see he was badly wounded, so I doubt he managed to swim out of that cavern. Now I sit here alone, listening to the shaelmaar devour the remains of the murdered sailors.<br><br>You! The person who has found my journal, whoever you may be! Take the rest of my fortune – for what good is a chest of jewels to a pile of moldy bones? But in exchange, please, drink to my health, to my sad fate, to the hero of a true elven tragedy.

   1211732|9ca772f5||Report on Knight Errantry Activities in the Duchy of Toussaint #31/g/22/ul/1271<br><br>The day of this writing saw the end of criminal enforcement activities directed against one Antoine Straggen, alias Starling. The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at the Silver Salamander Inn – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the ruins of Arthach Palace. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Antoine Straggen, wanted by writ of law in Metinna, Gheso and Nazair, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 40% to take into account the tax on unsyndicated butchers and immediate payment in species.

All indications suggest the deceased were associated with the “hanse” (colloquial term for the type of criminal organization sometimes called a “vandaguild”) led by a certain Antoine Straggen which had been conducting operations of a looting and pillaging nature in the area.<br>The standard reward for the completion of such a task was paid immediately and in species. In consideration of the great social benefit of this act (the owner being the ducal treasury), no tax was charged for this service.

I’m on my own. Thanks to that flying silver hen I can live like a Zerrikanian pasha. The lads are glad, too, because finishing off merchants is not at all bad, as work goes – doesn’t tire you much and blood can be washed off. And what loot! Yesterday, for example, a caravan drove through full of barrels of rum and dried ham. Did we ever have ourselves a feast… Which is why I’m telling you, brother, ditch that brothel business and join my band of merry men! I’m sure Mum cries herself to sleep every night, thinking of her son working in a bordello, and it’ll do her heart good to know I’ve got an eye on you.<br><br>Your Elder Brother,<br>Bartolomeu-Martin Tchéhovsky

   1211291|43c32c43||Dear Jean-Louis.<br><br>As you instructed, I have taken a post as Assistant Royal Hairdresser to King Tancred Thyssen and have been active in that position for two months.<br><br>I dash this note off to you now because I must inform you of a most startling development. After weeks of analysis, consultations with specialists and trial runs on model doppelgangers, the Chief Royal Hairdresser, Master Hector, has decided to give Marziaola, the king’s current favorite, a… bob! Of course, Marzaiola, being a mere king’s mistress, cannot indulge in such extravagances as an asymmetric bob or an daringly shaved nape, therefore her bob is rather of the classically elegant sort, with a fringe that wonderfully complements the line of her eyes and covers her altogether unfortunate forehead.<br>Just as we speculated, the bob shall soon make a triumphant reentry as the absolute rage of the royal salon, and thanks to me, you, my dear friend, are now the first hairdresser of the South to know about it! I thus declare my mission accomplished and a stunning success! I’ll gather up my trappings and prepare to return. I hope you are ready for a long and eventful tête-à-tête once I arrive, and I hope that will be soon, for this seaside climate really does not suit me one bit, and this swill they call wine in Kovir is positively disgusting.<br><br>Warm Embraces,<br>Edgard Lavalliere

   1211199|3ec11d1a||The Belhaven school of drama, also known as the “school of the second entrance,” was defined by the director and playwright Severen Stallis. Stallis was a proponent of intensifying the dramatic action in the second act, during which the most characteristic aspect of his work would take place: the main character’s second entrance. During the second act, the play’s hero would also be forced to undergo a distinct transformation, one which would determine the fate he would meet in the third.<br>The Belhaven school stood in opposition to the Beauclair tradition of drama, where the second act rarely saw the principal characters through any serious transformations. Its role was rather to build tension en route to the grand finale taking place in the third act.

   1206165|58ec41db||Dear Gabriel,<br>As you are surely aware, in the wake of the count’s death, all responsibility for the care and management of Belgaard has fallen on me. In that capacity I turn to you for help, for you are both the best rhabdomancer in all the duchy and also a dear friend, so I pray you will not refuse me your services. Curious how your services might be needed by me in managing my vineyard? I shall soon tell you.<br><br>Before his death, Count Crespi ordered an extraordinary valuable batch of seedlings and if we do not plant them in the very near future, they shall all wither and perish. Sadly, the count left no record of where in the estate we are to prepare the ground for these seedlings. The geologist whom the count had summoned to show us the most fitting soil collected his (hefty) retainer, then disappeared. I would not be surprised to learn he was a common cheat. But let us get to the heart of the matter. I wish to ask you to use your rhabdomancical talents to locate where we should plant these valuable vines. I dare trust you shall take pity on an old friend and see to the task right away. Belgaard’s coffers are, it is true, empty, but I think I shall find a way to compensate you for your troubles.<br><br>Your Friend, Thierry Pires,<br><br>P.S. Be careful, for ever since Count Crespi’s death, this area has not been as safe as it once was.

   1206168|cdd9c5da||Ladislas!<br><br>They’ve robbed the barrels from our storehouse. We must prepare a new batch, and quickly, efficiently. Read your instructions carefully: Chop down 8 chestnuts. Prepare planks from them as quickly as you can, then send the planks to be lyed. Then find 12 acacias, chop them down and remove the bark. We’ll apply finish to the chestnuts as soon as they’re back from leaching. Don’t let any lads go out to work alone – send them out in twos at the least. I’ve heard those voracious yellow plants are liable to sprout up anywhere. They are a true bane… so be careful!<br><br>Augustine Cooper
   1206174|9a3e2998||Dearest Cousin,<br><br>Based on what I gathered from your last letter, rumors about Belgaard’s overtaxed condition are not exaggerated. In my opinion, there’s no point you waiting for the new owner. The procedures involved in transferring such an important vineyard will last months, and meanwhile the estate will fall into ruin. You wrote you had to fire all the vineyard’s guards – who will now protect you from wild animals? You know full well how many of them lurk in the Caroberta Woods! They could attack you at any moment! I worry for you. I’ve already spoken to Master Fabricio and he thinks a skilled steward such as yourself will quickly find work over here.

   1206235|984c057e||The fiendish slurpers of blood—the vampyres, so-called—the dead and yet alive, called by others—are cunning beasts—verily, some suspect they even reason and converse—yet beasts they remain. These vampyres lead solitary existences—even their beastly and abominable ilk, they shun. The bloodslurpers are not idly named, for the blood of other beings is their bread. They hack apart their victims with sharp claws—daggers, in truth, though of one with their flesh. Upon feasting thus they grow in foul force and can turn into flying rats—gaining these animals’ keen hearing and also a sense of smell to match that of hound or hind.<br> <br>It is our luck seasoned hunters of bloodslurpers know ruses with which to trick these horrors and slay them without excessive risk. To kill a vampire easily and surely, it is enough to lure him into the light of the sun. He will then disintegrate into a fine dust at once, ready to be scattered to the four corners of the earth by the next gust. Yet well-advised is it to further equip oneself with garlic, lest the horror crawl too close and strike out at the hunter with its dagger-claws. Vampyres fear garlic with all-consuming terror—the mere smell of it reduces them to violent heaving and sobbing. In this moment should the hunter pound into the beast’s heart a sharpened stake—the second best weapon (the first being the sun) for the killing of the bloodslurpers.

   1206237|440625ce||Est Est, often considered one of the chief treasures of the people of Toussaint, is the best known of the wines cultivated in that region. It is hard to determine when, exactly, the first barrels of Est Est were matured, though we can surmise it must have been around the time of the first human forays into the duchy’s present lands. What is certain is that this wine truly gained fame only during the reign of Duchess Adela Marta, who held Est Est in near divine esteem and for that reason bestowed upon Castel Ravello the privilege of being the official ducal vineyard. She also reserved a special place in the cellars of the Beauclair Palace for Est Est, and to this day two barrels of every vintage are ceremoniously deposited on those shelves. The tapping of any of them is, by order of the ducal edict “Vino Sanctus Est,” punishable by death through dragging behind a team of horses.

   1206246|f01383e1||Though Pomino does not enjoy the fame of Est Est or even Erveluce, it still attracts a considerable number of admirers and remains among the best wines in the world. Few, however, know how close the world came to losing its slightly acrid, surprisingly deep aftertaste. The cause of this averted disaster was Phylloxera Mortifera, that is to say, Phylloxera the Deadly, a species of aphid whose sudden attack nearly wiped out all existing vines of this variety. For many weeks no one was able to exterminate this pest and it seemed Pomino was doomed to extinction. In the end, however, the aphids were defeated by ducal alchemists and a carefully selected group of vintners was appointed to ensure its vines took root at Castel Ravello once more. Some experts from the time of the plague claim their restoration efforts introduced cross-contaminants and never again were they able to extract from this grape that same bottomless flavor as before.

Yet neither the knights errant nor the druids nor anyone else proved up to the task – until a poor raftsman named Flovive figured out a way. He serenaded the frogs with his violin and they, entranced by his melody, followed him out of the duchy. In memory of this event, the settlement where Toussaint’s raftsmen dwell bears his name.

   1205969|ce293f09||One of the most extraordinary individuals I have encountered during my numerous adventures at Geralt’s side was the vampire known as Regis. To be precise, he was known as Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. By his own reckoning, he was 428 years old and was the descendant of unfortunate beings trapped in our world during the Conjunction of Spheres.<br>You are surely thinking, Dear Reader, about katakans alps and other such monsters and are pondering how it was that the witcher – who, it must be admitted, is a slayer of monsters – came to keep such company. I must here explain that Regis was a higher vampire, a creature which physically does not differ all that much from a man. Higher vampires are also much more powerful than their wild confreres, and their regenerative abilities significantly outpace those of anything else you have encountered or can even imagine.<br><br>But it is not because of his outer appearances or inner strengths that Regis became our dear companion. True, he could be pretentious and rather pompous in his frequent length perorations, but one would be hard-pressed to find in him the haughtiness usually present in higher beings.<br><br>Regis valued human life dearly and refused to kill unless forced to do so. As he once confessed, higher vampires do not in fact need to drink blood at all in order to survive. They treat it somewhat as we treat alcohol. A rough grasp of this dynamic might be given to you by the fact that, when we met him, Regis had been abstinent for years.<br><br>He never revealed to us why he decided to join our search for Ciri. He had never met her before. Nor did he live to see her. He died at Stygg Castle, during the battle against the mad mage Vilgefortz, who was responsible for the whole affair. He died for a cause which he surely did not fully understand, but he did it to defend those he held dear and simply because it was the right thing to do.<br><br>I shall always remember him as an rural surgeon reeking of herbs – that is how he came to us during our first encounter at the Fen Carn necropolis, when he treated me and my companions to a fantastic brew he made from mandrake root. Wherever you are, my friend, bottoms up!

   1206001|3dbb8657||Monstrous curses and their description <br><br>Introduction<br><br>Curses that change a fellow into a monstrous creature have existed since the dawn of time. They have a variety of origins and a variety of effects. It normally happens that a mage or sorceress casts a curse and the spell changes the subject. It doesn't always happen straight away. Sometimes, the person who has been cursed changes slowly bit by bit. It also happens that a normal fellow can cast a curse, someone whose conscience is clear and who has done good in their life. Such a person can acquire power and thus the aggrieved can place a curse on the evildoer. Such curses are strong and cannot be removed easily. Thus, everything by which human suffering is atoned is long lasting and painful.

What is fear? <br>H.B. - It's a feeling that destroys every other feeling. It controls your head and your heart. <br>E.H. - What do you mean? I thought it was a kind of pain. I have carried out tests in my laboratory on people and I discovered that a mother subject to appropriate stimuli is able to forget about her child and think only about how to avoid pain. So fear would be similar to pain? <br>H.B. - No. Pain rules the body, but fear is born in the heart. <br>E.H. - Oooh yes… What you say is very interesting… I think I will have to examine your heart in the laboratory. <br>H.B. - What do you mean… examine? <br>E.H. - I mean examine. Take it out and subject it to a proper examination. <br> H.B. - But, sir, that would… kill me! <br>E.H. - Yes, your mortality is a great inconvenience, but was not me who created your species and I am not responsible for its excessive frailty. <br><br>The conversation was carried out in human language in such it was written down.

A father who must abandon his own child ceased to be a father, and his heart shall never know comfort. Sadly, as a result of what has happened I have no other choice. We, along with the rest of the household, must abandon our estate. It is because that curse took you from us, leaving in your stead a mindless, bloodthirsty creature.<br><br>We shall go north, to Kovir, and if you ever read this letter (which could only mean you have returned to human form) you are to look for us there. For my part I can only promise each year I will send an envoy who will be tasked with checking in on you, seeing if you are alive and, if so, in what form. Faith that you will once again be my beloved Marlene gives me the strength to live on. Perhaps the curse will not last forever. Perhaps someone will come along you can lift this burden from you.<br><br>Farewell.<br><br>Your Loving Father

No doubt you wonder why I have drawn you out here, and why we cannot meet in person. You see, in my present situation, any kind of meeting is very risky – not so much for me, as for the person with whom I meet, for I am afflicted by a curse, or (as I hope, and why I have turned to you), the side effects of medicine given to me some time ago by a herbalist.<br><br>Soon after I visited this herbalist, she disappeared without trace. I desperately wish to understand my illness, so I wish to hire you to find her. When you do, learn as much from her as you can about the medicine she gave me. If my suffering is a result of her wickedness, then make her provide an antidote. I assure you I have ample wealth and will reward you with no small part of it for your services.<br><br>If it turns out my suffering is not the fault of the herbalist, please let her go. I will then have a different task for you, because this shall mean I am afflicted by a terrible curse which only the gods can cure. I believe it was cast upon me by a certain beggar who came by the manor while I was hosting a soiree for a few friends. If you can find that vagrant, I will pay you double. Sadly, all I remember of him is that he sold mirrors. I am aware this is not much aid for your hunt, yet I trust in your considerable talents and wish you the best of luck.<br><br>Marlene de Trastamara

Fourfingers had us pitch camp near Delenfer Pass, and to keep from going daffy with boredom we set out on a little reconnaissance mission and happened across a merchant caravan. Sadly, we got a bit carried away – instead of gagging and hog-tying them, the lads sharpened some stakes and stuck the fat feckers on them. That was terribly exhausting work, but we had good fun doing it, and no cleft kisser can take that away. There was one skinny snipe amongst them, but we left him for later. What matters is, their wagons were packed full of quality wine just begging to be guzzled!<br><br>Naturally we established watches, so not everyone would get shloshed at once, as is only common sense.

   1205843|e2f6634b||Contrary to appearances, Toussaint does not live and die by the wine trade alone. It also exports valuable building materials and a great quantity of wool. The clover-rich slopes of Mont Crane provide sustenance to a broad variety of sheep, including the famed Toussaint merinos, whose fleece fetches mind-boggling sums. Basane is one of the estates specializing in the breeding and pasturing of these remarkable beasts.

The story of his alcohol-fueled romps number today among the most cherished of traditional Toussaint tales. This state of perpetual tipsiness might just be what drove his decision to surround the duchy with a series of castles, meant to protect Toussaint from the barbarous highlanders of Mount Gorgon. Thing is, no one has ever heard of such a folk.

The Aen Seidhe left behind a great many smaller and larger structures whose function can today only be guessed at. An example of this are the Termes Palace ruins, which some tie to the legendary resting place of the last elven king, while others consider them a temple to some forgotten deity. What they were in truth, we shall never know.

   1205848|1ee60f44||The Office of Internal Revenue hereby announces a limited live auction to be held regarding the sale of a piece of developed real estate and accompanying agricultural land located in the Caroberta Woods region, having been left to the Ducal Treasury by the late Count Crespi, who departed this world without any heirs. Due to the unique nature of the Belgaard Estate and its important role in the production of wine bringing great fame to the duchy in all corners of the world, only subjects of the Duchy of Toussaint shall be allowed to participate in the auction.<br><br>To all knights errant and other such men of arms - be it known far and wide that the services of voluntary keepers of the peace shall be needed. Minor problems are expected to arise during the transfer of the above-mentioned real estate, and said problems, for their dissolution, could require the application of direct physical force. All volunteers are asked to report to the field office of the Procurator General of Toussaint near Plegmund’s Bridge, that is to say, to the place where the auction shall be held.

   1205854|4e4c63fd||Toussaint can boast many world-famous vineyards, such as Castel Ravello, Pomerol, Vermentino and Tufo. Their owners take great care to maintain the time-tested traditions and heirloom recipes on which the reputation of the wines they produce rests.  But Toussaint is also home to numerous smaller vineyards which do not even possess their own crests and whose wines have yet to win any particular renown, making it difficult to say much about them. Hortense is just such a place.

   1205852|f5e63e52||The Caroberta Woods are named after Toussaint’s reigning duchess’ grandmother – Duchess Carolina Roberta – who loved organizing elaborate games of hide and seek in this forest. A small trappers’ post located on its outskirts has grown into the tranquil village known as Francollarts. Here hunters, woodcutters and beekeepers come to sell the fruit of the woods. The village springs to life once a year, when Baron Trastamara organizes his annual Wood Festival and invites all the court out for a spectacular hunt.

Few, however, realize the duchy’s lands are rich with deposits of slate and other valuable building materials, and that the quarrying of such was once the bedrock of local livelihoods. Thus when gods-fearing Toussaintois saw fit to build a statue of the saintly Lebioda, they had no need to send for materials from abroad – instead, they merely reactivated Ardaiso.

After a long and storied career, he hung up his sword at his ancestral manor and settled in for a well-deserved retirement. No one knows what brought about the subsequent murder of his entire family. Some claim a giant descended from the mountains, others, that he ran afoul of one of the larger hanses.

Master Faramond, who led the renovation efforts, did what he could, but some of the more delicate plants could not be saved. Today this popular recreation spot for courtiers is filled mainly with spruces, olive trees, Beauclair oaks, rose bushes, juniper thickets, rhododendrons and, of course, grapevines.

   1205881|242d2e4d||Experts know the secret to Toussaint wine lies not in the vines of its hills but in the oaks of its forests. So desirable are barrels made from this wood, it seemed loggers would cut the duchy clear until protests from angry druids stopped them. After years of negotiations, a compromise was reached and a special organization, the Coopers’ Guild, was created. Thanks to its strict supervision of the industry, logging became sustainable and it became the richest guild in the city – as evinced by the proud gate it funded.

   1205887|2c3b5ba0||When laying the stones of the defensive walls surrounding Hauteville, the inhabitants of Beauclair had no inkling how much their city would eventually grow. The mushroom-like expansion of San Sebastian and the Port District forced Beauclair's residents to knock through an additional passageway to facilitate the circulation of traffic between the capital’s districts. Some even called for the walls to be torn down altogether – for what had they to fear, with their town protected by the bravest knights errant the world has ever known?

   1205858|34965e7d||At Belgaard Vineyard, a famous act of poisoning once occurred which took the lives of a large gang of bandits who were ransacking the area. The folk charged with cleaning up in the aftermath originally planned to burn the bodies, but one pious soul thought even rotten dung-diddlers such as they deserve better. He thus paid for their bodies to be laid to rest in a small cemetery: Mère-Lachaiselongue. Later, Sir Ramon of Gichon died a martyr’s death here while trying to get rid of the bandits’ constantly returning wraiths.

   1205856|044c4cb9||This vineyard’s former owner racked up significant debts with a loan shark, who then sold them to bandits for collection. When they found he had no coin to collect, they murdered him alongside all other residents of his estate. As if that were not heinous enough, they then made the vineyard their base, from which they would hijack transports of wine to fuel their drunken orgies. So fierce and well-stocked were they, none could chase them off - until one brave alchemist spiced a transport crossing their territory with a powerful extract of ricin.
   1205860|1318cbb0||Toussaint is a vassal duchy of the Nilfgaardian Empire. Duchess Anna Henrietta is the rightful ruler of the region, but in practice she submits to the will of her dearest elder cousin - Emhyr var Emreis. It was certainly out of concern for Her Enlightened Grace and her little realm that the emperor founded an embassy in Toussaint, consisting of a handful of dignitaries who dwell in the duchy full-time and use their experience to help with her, de facto enlightened, decisions.

Currently the district is primarily home to laborers and their workshops and links Hauteville with the port – the center of trade for Beauclair and the entire duchy.

   1205713|d29f061f||I, Aweagnial, write this missive to you, elven brother from another time, to ensure memory of our sad fate never perishes.<br><br>After many failed attempts, the treacherous Dh’oine finally managed to reach King Divethaf and stick his flesh with steel. The court medics’ healing brews provided no succor and King Divethaf did not last the night. At that moment our morale, which had already suffered a great trial during the weeks-long siege, reached rock-bottom. But were we to allow the body of our leader to fall into the hands of the Dh’oine? Let them put his head on a pike?<br><br>The mage Barrfhionn did not have to ponder long. The king’s place is in his family crypt, in Cyttorhak. I was one of the volunteers who carried the body from the palace through underground tunnels.<br><br>Yet somehow the Dh’oine picked up our trail and attacked us in the temple. After a short battle, we made a unanimous decision. Barrfhionn shall leave and close the entrance to the crypts behind him. We shall stay behind and place the king in his grave. The mage hesitated a short while, yet knew the palace would fall without his support. He left, swearing he would soon return, once our troops have fought off the Dh’oine with the help of General Saempolinh, whose army should reach us any day now. [rest of letter illegible]

   1205372|4b3de703||My Dearest!<br><br>Everything here is good. For several days now the sun has been shining and it is quite hot, so the window in Clarissa's room is open almost all day. If you could see her little face when rays of sunlight hit it... Pure joy. She looks just like she was before the accident. If it gets a bit warmer, I will have her chair taken to the garden.<br><br>The day before yesterday, Master Buyvarde's wife, Elisa, visited us. You remember her don't you? When the Buyvarde's moved to Kovir, all the society ladies were scared of inviting her to dine as she seemed to be either mad or some sort of self-taught witch. This was all because, despite not having the right education, she made magic ointments and cosmetics. It is said that she spent three years in the Dragon Mountains learning from some elven sorceress... <br><br> You know I don't pay much heed to gossip, which is why when the butler announced her, I immediately invited her in for a glass of lemonade. It turns out that she is an exceedingly charming person, and stories of her alleged witchcraft are highly exaggerated -- she actually studied for three years at Aretuza, but because of some bad investments made by her father she had to leave the academy. She left, however, with a good knowledge of plants and their magical applications. She brought with her a healing ointment which I have to rub into Clarissa's legs each morning and evening for ten days. When the treatment is complete, Elisa promises to visit us again to see the results and advise us further. I have a good feeling about this woman. In my next letter, I'll tell you what happened with the treatment she recommended.<br><br>Take care of yourself my dearest. I beg that you don't overreact and do something silly, if something happened to you I wouldn't know what to do.<br><br>I love you,<br>Arabella

   1207959|1f6e42fa||Professor Noel Ivor's journal
   1207956|79eb1283||I am Filibert von Wittan, my Crest – a Rook, my father – the famed Sir Gruber “Palecheeks” von Wittan. Today I was smeared by an insult which only blood can wipe clean. Rage burns my entrails. Writing this is the only way I know to calm the flames.<br><br>When I am an old man and read these notes, I believe a certain Maximus Nonius Macrinus will be long dead. A pitiful memory. For now, however, he lives. Why do I write about this? A few days ago I challenged him to a duel. To the death. He had been drooling over my Lucienne and I could not bear it. He proved to be a better swordsman than I. But that is not the worst. A lost finger is nothing compared to lost honor. Maximus defeated me, yet instead of killing me, he spared my life. Never shall I forget the faces of the men who turned their eyes from me then.<br>I know I shall never know peace until I have dealt with him.<br><br>[a dozen or so blank pages]<br><br>I have found the journal which I was given by my father several years ago. During the time since I last held it, much has occurred in my life. I have fled Toussaint and sought my fortune in various places. With varied success. The worst, however, is that my hand has yet to grasp Maximus’ throat. I know it is only a matter of time.<br><br>I have decided to return to that hound-botched duchy. We have pitched camp on Mont Crane. I’ve carefully selected a band of men who will not flee from any task, any foe. The Toussaint which once forced me to run will now repay me in full. The highest price, however, shall be paid by Maximus Nonius Macrinus. When I get my hands on him, he will dream of one thing: death.<br>I’ve got the harlotsbrood! He’s lording it up at the Casteldaccia estate. He was given it by that sodden tart Anarietta – seems Duke Raymund’s been dead for a few years. Tomorrow my lads will pay him a visit. I shan’t go with them, however. The very thought of having to see his maggoty face again makes me ill. Farewell, Maximus, I have signed your death warrant.<br><br>I’m delighted. Maximus and all his family now rot. Their stench is a delight to stray mutts. Whenever I close my eyes, I see them perish. See them scream, moan and grovel. That makes my dinger stand firmer than even the curviest harlot could. I am at last satisfied.<br>

I do not wish to – I cannot face the truth.<br><br>I’m off. Alone, at the moment, for I do not wish them to see me when I find… I will begin by searching the ruins of the temple abutting the river.

This is an event renowned the world over and the lack of a representative of our order is a glaring omission and casts a dark shadow on the reputation of our Order.<br><br>Sadly, ever since the death of Brother Roderick de Wett, we have no worthy champion, and our most skilled brother, Patrick of Weyze, has contracted scrofula so fierce he cannot mount a horse even for a minute.<br><br>We thus trust the choice of you, brother, which is natural in this situation, will prove wise and you shall not betray the hope we have placed in you.<br><br>Immediately upon receipt of this letter go to the nearest branch of the Vivaldi Bank, where you will accept a transfer of coin in the amount of 784 crowns. These are your delegation funds, which you are obliged to return in full plus a 50% penalty if you do not take a place on the podium. Brother Adalbert, who – as you know – has taken on the role of specialist in the matters of the Order’s view in the public eye, has calculated that a loss on the part of our representative will cause more damage than not taking part in the tourney at all. So you understand our position.<br>May the Eternally Flaming Rose lie your path in this endeavor!<br><br>Brother Evariste of Metinna, First Secretary of the Order

   1207941|a611ed3e||To Sir Donimir of Troy,<br>Greetings!<br>I have learned from a well-informed source you shall take part in the knights’ tourney in Toussaint.<br><br>Putting aside the fact of that duchy’s dubious reputation, loose morals, tendency for debauchery, drunkenness and lechery, the fact its noblewomen are said to ride around on horses topless, their enormous breasts bouncing in the breeze, for hours on end, and the fact its knights errant fight not for the hands of the above-mentioned ladies but for the hands and elsewise of each other, I must remind you that is terrain which to us, to the good subjects of the Northern Realms, is culturally foreign! If not hostile! For whoever is not with us is against us, and the so-called “neutral” reek of cowardice and treachery.<br><br>But allow me to get to the point.

Yet Count Jean-Joel Baillairgé – that’s what the impertinent prick made me call him –managed to assuage my irritation a dab by clinking a hefty pouch of Nilfgaardian florens on the table... [illegible fragment] ...his entourage loaded the ship with bundles, then hauled on this huge cage covered with a sail. Count Baillairgé explained it held one of those famed Zanguebarian striped horses – a gift for Duchess Henrietta.<br><br>Belhaven to Beauclair Route, 24th Day of Service<br>We’ve had nothing but trouble with this Zanguebarian horse! It gnaws on the deck like a beast gone mad. Plus we’ve got to make sure the tarp covering its cage is tightly fastened, for it seems this creature’s as sensitive to the sun’s rays as a vampire! In which case, what good’s it to the duchess, a striped horse she can only ride it at night? There’s no comprehending these aristocrats… [illegible fragment]<br><br>Belhaven – Beauclair Route, 25th Day of Service<br>A thousand thundering sea devils! That was no horse in that cage, but a gods-blasted shaelmaar! Overgrown rock rat chewed through the deck, capsized the ship and burrowed into the river bottom! Then that idiot Count Baillairgé fell to his knees and begged me to help catch the monster. He handed me the key to the chest of jewels he’d kept close watch on the whole trip and swore it’d be mine if we recaptured that monstrosity. I’d most like to grab a thick club, smack him upside the head and take that chest right now, but I’m not some ploughing pirate. I’ll gather the lads who managed to survive the wreck and we’ll try to catch the monster in our nets – the count claimed to know some trickery to use to sneak up on the beast...

Whatever they could not take and did not manage to demolish or burn, they cursed.<br><br>The last elven sovereign, Divethaf, hundreds of years old yet fair as a youth, was defeated. Weeping over the slain army of his forever-young brothers and sisters, he agreed to pay homage to Ludovic, the first human king of Toussaint (who, though young, was as shrunken and ugly as the night after Saovine).<br><br>Putting on no end of airs and graces, Ludovic boasted, “Look – the proud elf shall bow down before me and kiss my royal feet with humility!” To degrade Divethaf even further, Ludovic decided the homage should take place in the elf king’s barely-abandoned palace. The throne on which Ludovic now boldly lounged bore still-smoldering marks from the fire set by the elves, who had sought to burn the whole palace down as they left.<br><br>So the proud elven king bowed down before the human king and offered him a sacrifice of bread and wine, as well as his sword and shield.<br><br>Spewing out merciless mockery all the while, Ludovic received this homage, then immediately ordered his guards drag Divethaf beyond the palace gates and throw him down the stairs as if he were a beggar.<br><br>Witnesses claimed the proud elf remained calm throughout the whole event, but when left alone, Divethaf wiped the blood off his face and vowed cruel revenge on the king – revenge that would come from stone as cold as the king’s heart.<br><br>Yet these ominous words bore no fruit, for in the year 782, before the homage was renewed, Divethaf drew his last breath alongside his remaining soldiers when the Toussaintois decided to celebrate the anniversary of the surrender of the elven sovereign with a pogrom of non-humans on the slopes of Mount Gorgon. Few survived.

   1207185|36434bb4||Corvo Bianco’s origins have been lost to the mists of time. We have only a bare legend about the vineyard being founded by the owner of the Pomerol estate’s son, who had been disinherited and exiled with only a Carvanere sapling to his name.<br><br>The modern history of Corvo Bianco begins with Master Bolius, who settled in the vineyard in his elder years. As a young man, Bolius had headed a division of sappers which fought in the far north. For his service, he was made a noble and awarded a great deal of coin. He took to rebuilding Corvo Bianco with great zeal. He dedicated the most energy to planting a beautiful garden for his wife, thus starting the craze for the use of herbs which swept Toussaint at the time. After his wife, Bolius’ second love was the olive tree, which is why he planted a great many of them all over Corvo Bianco.<br><br>When Bolius’ wife died, life lost its savor for him and he began to think constantly about death. He sold his estate to Count Crespi, and the very day he signed the last piece of paperwork, he died.

Personally, I’ve nothing against this, but I know where you are – in Dol Blathanna – that would be unthinkable.<br>I went to visit Maolsheachlann’s grave recently… Yes, I know you won’t approve of that. Since when do the Aen Seidhe care for the graves of their loved ones? Yet living among people necessarily means we take on some of their customs. While there, I happened to learn the humans plan to build a village near Crevan Carn. This is difficult, for personally it does not bother me, but Bláthnaid – you know her – began screaming about how this was a profanation and they have countless other perfectly good spots where they could build their village. I hope this will not grow into some larger conflict, we have it so good here… [rest of the letter is illegible]

I wanted to explain to him in no uncertain terms I cannot marry him and for him to let me go… But I got drunk, and his eyes, there was this touching sadness in them… He’d brought me a purse of jewels as an offering – I poured them out onto the ground and covered them with dirt, saying I will marry him when they sprout into vines… François... he didn’t understand... But at least he agreed to leave me alone for the rest of the day.

An ill omen.<br><br>Once I get by the water, I look, and there caught up in the nets is a human head.

Yes, yes, I know, it takes a great deal of patience and you have to separate the wheat from the chaff, but it’s the best way to learn about local legends. That’s how we came to find Fox Hollow, where they say the soil sprouts clay pots (!).<br><br>28th of July<br>We dug up part of a vineyard on the outskirts of Fox Hollow, but what we found there… those were not pots, those were elven funeral urns! It seems the village is built atop an ancient Aen Siedhe necropolis... That cemetery dates, by my reckoning, to the time before the First Landing, so the graves might be full of valuables. The ancient elves buried their dead along with great wealth. We’ve already dug up a few choice baubles, but I’m sure if we look deeper we will find much more.<br><br>12th of August<br>Today we started a new dig, in a new location. Matthias spied a beautifully ornamented cameo in the ground, and when he tried to grab it… he discovered it was clenched in the hands of a skeleton. Anselm started to mock him, but quickly lost all desire to laugh. The valley was full of elven skeletons – men, women, even children... The bodies were all mixed, with limbs lopped off, many heads missing and children with crushed rib cages… what happened here?!<br><br>14th of August<br>Another sleepless night. Blood, cries, wails… I awake drenched in sweat, then I doze off for a moment and the same happens again. I told my fellows to dig a deep hole We’ll throw that cursed cameo inside – it belongs in the ground, with the rest of the dead.<br><br>16th of August<br>Matthias disappeared during the night. No one saw him leave camp, his things are all in place… Anselm says we should follow his example and flee while we still live, but I… I cannot leave it like this! This valley is full of bones… Anselm screamed in my face, called me a madman, but I MUST tell someone what we have found.

Had the gall to deliver a pouch of coin to me at the embassy. Said it was my share. I spit on his coin, but I’m afraid I’ll need it, soon enough… I hid what he gave me in a safe place. Ever since Old Ralph died, no one buys wooden planters anymore, so his workshop’s the perfect hiding spot.<br><br>29th Day of Service<br>Graybill told me to keep my ears open at the embassy, find out when they’ll have another caravan to grab. As if as an afterthought, he added the guard commander would be quite shocked to learn about my role in the previous hijacking… I stole the next convoy’s route from the secretary’s office. It’s the price I must pay for my idiot idea of going in cahoots with Graybill Pellegrin.<br><br>31st Day of Service<br>The transport’s set off. This time it’s escorted by Arnold aep Bluhm – commander of the embassy guard. Graybill’s men don’t know they’re in for - a fight against elite soldiers. When he finds out… Then it’s time to get out of here. Coin I set aside should be enough to start afresh, somewhere far, far away. Maecht seems like a good direction.

So we’ll pivot, instead of slaughtering merchants and knights – we’ll sell teapots!<br><br><br>Day 182<br>Felt like my spirit was trying to crawl out my bum, that’s how badly our kitchen crew botched our last batch of vittles. When knights errant attacked us after that, not a man among us was strong enough to hold a sword. We’ve got to get our hands on a real cook – only thing more dangerous than an imbecile with a sword is an imbecile in charge of a cooking pot. Perhaps a quick raid of the Cockatrice? Fishermen’s chowder would be a pleasant change after all this stew de dog-doo-doo!

   1206938|cd7ddd87||I’d always enjoyed practicing my craft. Killing came as naturally to me as blowing my nose. They raised me to be a knight, and being a brigand’s not much different. First, blood and swords, then wine and harlots to wash the worries away. But ever since that horrid night… everything has changed. My dreams are filled with nightmares in which I relive those events, step by step…<br><br>We took the estate by storm and pulled Maximus Macrinus out of his bedding, still in his nighties. Yet we had to put off dealing with him and first see to his family. Those were our orders, like it or not, but… it’s one thing to impale some corpulent cow-diddler with a wine-stained mustache and quite another to string up a snot-nosed runt. He squealed like a little girl when the lads threw the noose around his neck. Macrinus tried to buy us off – even showed me the candlestick lever that opens the hidden vault where he hides his family treasures, but Filibert’s orders were clear.<br><br>Next up was Maximus’ wife… the lads spent a long time having their way with her and making Maximus watch. Too long. I didn’t know the harlotsbrood and haven’t a clue what he did to Filibert to make him wish such a fate on him and his family, but… That was too much for me. Only once his whole clan was swinging did we turn our attention to Macrinus. We stuck him with hot pokers, cut off his ears, then slit his gut… and he… throughout all this horror he didn’t scream once. Only groaned under his breath. When it came time for him to die, in a puddle of his own excrement, under the tree where we’d hanged his wife and son… he looked me in the eyes and whispered, “Vengeance will be mine! In this life, or the next!” Those were his last words. Dark clouds filled the sky in that instant, and a harsh gale sprung up… Then I gave the order to move out.<br><br>I remember perfectly how, when I reported this back to Filibert, he was all smiles. Happy as a clam. Didn’t even harangue me for not looting the manor. It was clear he cared about one thing, and one thing only: Macrinus’ death.<br><br>Yet news of the treasure we left at Casteldaccia quickly spread around Mont Crane and a few lads from our hanse are fixing to head over there to see what they can find. I’ll join them. I’ll bury the remains still lying there, in the yard – maybe then their spirits will know peace. Maybe I’ll wipe away at least some of my sins. Maybe at last I’ll be able to sleep soundly.

   1206866|66e3d97a||Dear Diary,<br>It’s been three weeks since Lady Orianna took me off the street. At last I've something to eat and drink and play with other children every day. It’s even better than at home, for at home there rarely was anything to eat and when mummy died, there was never anything at all.<br><br>Today I played with Miri and Tomm – first we played Duck, duck, goose, then hide and seek, then pick-a-stick. Then we played tag. I had a lot of fun! Then a cart from Lady Orianna came and there was lots of food. There were sweet rolls, fruit and cake, and many other tasty things. Lady Orianna is the best!<br><br>Lady Orianna visited us early in the morning. First she talked with us, then she sang to us, and then she took Johnny to the other room. We were all jealous of him. When he came back, he was a little pale and had small red marks on his neck, but he also had a huuuge bag of chocolates! Miri says sometimes Lady Orianna takes a child and does something to them, I didn’t really understand what, but then they get a gift from her. I hope next time she takes me!<br><br>Today’s rainy and I’m really bored. Tomm said I’m stupid, but I don’t believe him because he's stupid, too. Maybe Lady Orianna will come tomorrow and I’ll get a gift from her. That will show him!<br><br>She chose me! Lady Orianna came and chose me! I went to the other room with her, she told me to show her my neck, and then she kind of bit me. It didn’t really hurt, I just felt dizzy later. But that’s not important because she gave me a wooden sword! Nobody has one like that! Tomm will be so jealous!

Never been a jelly-kneed milksop, mind, but one look at this lot and I near soiled my hose. Why, just the other day they picked up this chap in the woods who was out gathering mushrooms, all bright eyes and innocence. After an hour of our lads having their “fun” with the fellow, he was begging to be sent to his makers. Soon as he said as much, Fourfingers pointed his remaining digits straight at me. I wasn’t surprised -- being new and all, it was only natural I had to prove my chops – but nor was I exactly eager. But what could I do? Hold my nose and slit the boy’s throat, that’s what.<br><br>Ugh, I can still feel the sickly warmth of his blood on my hands, no matter how much emulsion I use. Don’t get me wrong, I’d killed before – but always in self-defense, or at least in circumstances which a generous mind or a shrewd barrister could cast in that mold. But no barrister will do me any good if the lads find out my stomach curdled when I did the deed. Then it’s out of the club with me, and that’s the best case scenario, if Filibert’s in a lenient mood. Otherwise… why, I don’t even want to think about it.

Most recently they snatched up Gilbert, plucked him right off the wall. Gilbert was usually quite alert, but every man drops his guard a bit when emptying his water. Filibert’s furious. The cost of schooling a fresh-faced recruit into a functional member of our group is not inconsiderable. To have that cost turned into monster droppings – that’s regrettable waste.<br>Day Seven<br>We ambushed a caravan of merchants trekking from eastern Toussaint. They had no guards and put up no resistance, yet still we made virtually no profit – the shoddy rags they carried could only interest bare-bummed Skellige wildmen, and none of our group plans to voyage in that direction. Filibert grew furious yet again and killed one of the merchants, a man named Lumierex. The rest set off back east.<br>Day Eleven<br>Our scouts tracked down three men sneaking through the woods. They were all dressed as beggars and claimed to be such. We weren’t fooled. After a bit of rough play, they were revealed to be jewelers carrying gold from the mines of Maecht. Unrefined ore only, but of promising grade. Filibert ordered the jewelers killed. He hates liars with a passion.<br>Day Seventeen<br>An expedition from the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian’s pitched tent on the other side of the Sansretour. Scholars are not known to suffer from excess wealth, yet these have capacious tents and ample amounts of alcohol. Thus their fate was sealed. Filibert sent a few men their way.<br>Day Twenty-Three<br>It’s been almost two weeks since anything of interest came along the high road. Meanwhile, knights errant have caught more of our lads. Two died, one was merely wounded and escaped. We lost equipment worth a great many crowns. Filibert ordered the wounded man flogged for carelessness. His weary body couldn’t take it and he died.<br>Day Twenty-Four<br>Our luck has turned. We caught a vintner’s caravan returning from the South. They had sold their goods and were carrying a great deal of coin. Preliminary calculations estimate takings of around four hundred crowns for each of us. Filibert has yet to decide if we will divide it equally.<br>Day Twenty-Eight<br>The unit sent to Basane Farm never returned with supplies. The vittles situation is tight. Man cannot live on alcohol alone, nor has anyone yet found a way to eat gold. We must plunder a few villages.<br>Day Thirty<br>I shall now perform a final accounting of the month of Blathe.

   1206896|2b5520a9||(...) In recent decades, many of us have come to believe that a much more effective way of obtaining good quality human blood than hunting individuals is their systematic, controlled husbandry. Apart from the obvious advantages, such as being able to control what the flock eats and the ability to crossbreed specific individuals to obtain offspring with the best hemoglobin, another clear advantage to breeding human flocks is that domesticated humans held in confinement, as opposed to those in their natural habitat (i.e. "villages" and "towns"), become less aggressive, and therefore less troublesome.<br><br>When it comes to farming humans, there are various schools, of which two seem to have gained the widest acceptance in recent times - namely battery-cage and free-range husbandry. This thesis describes in detail the advantages and disadvantages as well as the methods of carrying out each type of breeding. As an introduction, it is worth mentioning the basic differences between both types.<br><br>Battery-cage human husbandry (described very accurately and in detail in the book <i>Human Husbandry</i>) is the placing of several male and female individuals in a closed, restricted space, with permanent access to air, food and water. This form of breeding differs from free range in that the flock is not permitted to leave the breeding area and is held captive the entirety of their lives.<br><br>Free-range, on the other hand, involves leaving the flock in its natural habitat or creating a habitat that simulates it closely (i.e. creating villages, more on which can be found in the chapter - Human Villages: Establishing and Growing a Herd), and then making the herd psychologically or physically dependent on its owner. The most effective method for making a human individual dependent is guaranteeing it safety and permanent access to high quality feed. It is worth adding that a human that trusts its owner does not feel fear and does not defend itself when having its blood drunk, which limits the production of noradrenaline and cortisol, which have a negative impact on the taste of the blood. Furthermore, it may happen that a domesticated free-range human may feel a certain pleasure when its owner drinks its blood (most likely associated with sexual tension), which causes an intensification in the blood's flavor.

It soon became clear, however, that for the ambitious Amadeus, this was just the beginning. He quickly expanded the business, establishing Cianfanelli Bank branches in Kovir and Nazair and even sending a representative to Zerrikania. He became known for treating each and every customer as an old friend and cared deeply about what became of others’ coin. He thus created a wide range of banking products to better allow him to look after the property of an increasingly greater number of customers. He coined the phrase that up until today has served Cianfanelli as an advertising slogan and motto: “We look after your coin as if it were our own.”

   1206746|8bd9fc9e||Beledal: The True Story of a Poultry-Raising Genius<br><br>Malcolm Beledal came into this world in a small village to the north of Beauclair. He expressed great interest in all kinds of farming from his earliest years. He began by growing beets and onions, but soon grew bored of them, for vegetables were too inert for his energetic disposition. He then switched tracks and tried farming his friends. He locked them in an old shed and fed them hay for a week. The boys laughed at first, but soon became angry with him. Ultimately, they managed to scratch a hole in the shed’s thatch and climb out. Little Beledal’s hyperactivity finally proved useful to him then, for he had to run quite a long time before his friends finally gave up the chase. This adventure taught him an important lesson: friends make poor farm animals.<br><br>As vegetables and friends were out of question, Beledal decided to focus on animals. He started farming ants. He took a huge ant colony, put it in a bucket and placed the bucket on a window sill. Tragically, Beledal forgot it was the middle of summer and sun pounded down relentlessly. The very next morning, all the ants were roasted. Beledal ate them up, then decided to try farming bigger animals next time.<br><br>He began raising a pig, but soon took a liking to her. He named her Betsy and walked her every day. One evening, while scoffing down a braised pork knuckle, he learned it had belonged to Betsy. Oh, what torment that was for young Beledal! Desperate, he even tried to take his own life. However, after several years passed, Beledal decided to give his passion for farming one more chance. He raised a flock of chickens. They were much livelier than vegetables, considerably bigger than ants and not as intelligent as pigs. Beledal’s passion bloomed as never before. Over the years, he developed his farm so much that he became a legend.

   1206299|bcbdd427||My Dearest Brother,<br><br>I'm so excited to hear you will be organizing a tournament where the players will be able to test the new faction. I think this is a fabulous idea. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make an appearance. My health has taken a sudden turn for the worse. The medics don't see much hope for me. Oh well... everyone shall have their turn, as our father would say. I've had a good life and do not regret anything. Well, except perhaps for a few choice cards I lost over the years, but you cannot gain without risking something.<br><br>This very well might be the last letter I write to you, so I'd like you to know I am very proud of you. A gwent tournament using the new faciton, that is the idea of a lifetime. Do not worry about those who oppose your changes - and indeed the notion of change itself. There shall always be malcontents. Those such as yourself should let intuition guide them and follow the path of progress. Where would our world be today if we allowed only the nearsighted, the unimaginative, to steer our affairs? No doubt stuck in a dark cave, with warming fires and illuminating candles beyond our reckoning. Thus I retain high hopes for your tournament and wish it all the best. I believe it shall soon be the finest, most prestigious gwent tournament in all the world. <br><br>Your brother – Igor.

You might as well’ve took a reesty dump on the graves of our ancestors. Folk who don’t respect tradition don’t deserve my respect either, so shut your fucking freakshow down now or I’ll shut it down for you and beat your daft heid into a bloody pulp while I’m at it. And don’t think this an idle threat – note this letter is signed, because I’m not some fucking coward blowing off steam in anonymity, but an outraged citizen ready to take matters in his own hands. And there’s a shite-load of others ready to do the same with me.<br>With no fucking regards whatsoever,<br>Yaki

   1206277|32520858||That foolish flatulence fluffer Bruce has tried to cheat us again. But he won't get away with it this time! Take a pickaxe and a shovel and pay our dearly departed boss a visit. Her kitty face was hideous to look at even when she was alive, so the very thought of looking at it now she’s dead gives me the bloody runs. Take the jewels, pearls and other valuables bum-nibbling Bruce tossed into her grave. Oh, and if you see the milksop hanging around the cemetery, break his neck.<br><br>Robin<br><br>P.S. Apparently, ever since Selina's death, that kid's been moping near Orlémurs Cemetery, howling at the moon. If I know life, and I do, he's got with him the key to the chest we buried with that bitch. Perhaps we could end his suffering by ending his miserable life in the lake. If he hasn't drowned himself already, that is.

   1206322|60cff59d||Gwent: for many a diverting game of cards, for others, a noble pursuit, for some – a crippling addiction which devours their every coin and every waking moment. These last can be found most frequently among the dwarves, the game’s inventors and most passionate devotees. Their devotion extends to gwent’s paraphernalia, its cards most of all, which they craft with great care and skill - in fact, cards painted by dwarven masters are often considered miniature works of art. In past times they devoted equal attention to whittling the clubs which contestants once kept at their sides, to bash each other about the head with in the case of an argument. As brawls grew less common, the clubs became implied threats more than used weapons, until eventually falling into disuse and near oblivion.<br><br>Today gwent players can be found almost everywhere, from the Skellige Isles (where the game was introduced by the druid Ermion) to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br><br>In gwent, the play of cards mimics the dueling of two armies. The playing field is divided into two parts, each split into three rows. Nearest to the center stand units who fight at close quarters, behind them, archers and other such ranged attackers, and furthest back, machines and creatures used for siege purposes. Both players wield decks made up of a minimum of 22 unit cards and a maximum of 10 special cards, and each must also contain a leader card. The player who wins the toss of a coin (originally: the dwarf whose wife has the longest beard) plays first. Each player draws at random 10 cards from his deck and then is allowed to redraw 2 of these before the laying of cards begins. Each round is won by the player who has played cards of the greatest value. The first to achieve 2 victorious rounds wins, meaning a maximum of 3 rounds are played. The winner’s prize is agreed upon by the players before each match – most often, the wager is a bounty of coin or a rare card<br><br>The heart of the players’ armies, the unit cards, come in three types:<br>close combat units,<br>ranged combat units,<br>siege units.<br><br>Each such card is assigned a strength rating and may additionally possess special abilities.<br><br>There are also special cards which have no strength rating but instead influence the course of the game in other ways.<br><br>Unit cards depicting famed heroes not only have unusually high strength ratings, but also have the added benefit of ignoring the workings of all special cards. These are the rarest and most coveted of gwent cards. Most frequently they must be won from top players or purchased at a great price from collectors. <br><br>The cards in classic gwent are divided into four factions:<br>The Northern Realms, leader: Foltest<br>The Nilfgaardian Empire, leader: Emhyr var Emreis <br>Monsters, leader: Eredin Bréacc Glas<br>The Scoia'tael, leader: Francesca Findabair.

   1206330|e311626a||Bootlegger's notes. Reek of alcohol.
   1206329|697538a8||... so I say to that, “Minister Tremblay, the whole Sansretour Valley is overrated! Those wines, why, don’t get me started on Est Est - ever since they started mass-producing it, they should call it Était Était, for it's definitely seen better days.” Then he says, “Right you are, always been a Côte-de-Blessure chap myself. In fact, between you and me, I even prefer it to Sangreal” -  you know, the wine reserved for Her Illustrious Highness and her inner circle.<br><br>And then, the fool I am, I blurt out, “Oh, I agree, whenever Her Grace has me taste it, I’ve got to swill my mouth out with vodka afterwards, to wash out that rancid taste.” Oh, come on, I was drunk, wasn’t I? Talking out of my bum. Well, turns out I had rather overvalued my position at court. Tremblay needed but say a word in the duchess' ear and, in three shakes of a donkey's tail, I was out on the street. The job of ducal taster’s been given back to Benoit – can you believe it? After that scandal involving Baronesses Nique and Queline? As for me – well, what was I supposed to do? Had no choice but to start making and drinking my own brews – that’s always been my true passion.

   1206332|769b5e1b||Dear Pafnuzio,<br><br>As answer to your letter, I shall try to draw up from the recesses of my memory what I know about the first attempts to raise a statue to Lebioda in Toussaint.<br>It was, if my mind serves me, over half a century ago, during the reign of Anna Henrietta's grandmother, Duchess Carolina Roberta. The cult of Lebioda, popular in the North… [illegible fragment]<br>The cult was flourishing in Toussaint at that time due to the deeds of a supposed disciple of Lebioda - Plegmund. I say "supposed" because no one ever… [illegible fragment]<br>The miracles that Plegmund worked in those days were on everyone’s lips. Even one of my… [illegible fragment]<br>For Plegmund, though, the beautiful temple built according to his designs in the south of the city was not enough. He was out for something larger - literally! He managed to persuade the duchess that the most magnificent symbol of good people of Toussaint’s faith would be a statue...

   1206354|356b1bb2||To Whomever Finds This Letter:<br>My names is Julius ban Gavh'e and if you are reading these words, I am surely long dead. As befits one of my station and familial connections I was sent to study at Ban Ard, the famed school for mages, yet I was never to complete those studies. For the entire duration of my life magic held but a weak hold over a soul ravished by a passion for organic alchemy. It was to that most wondrous of sciences I dedicated the most beautiful years of my life, and the table beside which you now most surely stand is the fruit of those labors of love.<br><br>If you are a fellow lover of alchemy, I hazard to guess you will be filled with rapture to behold my discovery. If, however, that marvelous science is unknown to you, please heed my advice – drop this letter, step away from the table and never return. The practice of alchemy by amateurs can lead to injury and even death.<br><br>If you did not drop this letter after that last paragraph, you are no stranger to alchemy – thus I shall now reveal to you in a few brief words the fundaments of the alchemy table I designed. Leaving aside all unnecessary detail, my chief discovery consisted of a formula and tools allowing for the transmutation of mutagens taken from monsters into mutagens of the more common sort. I know this sounds highly unlikely, but I have proven with utmost certainty that this is possible.<br><br>The workings of this transmutation are simple – one must simply make use of the table which I designed. As an expert in the arcane art of alchemy, you certainly already know your way around such devices. If you are but an amateur, a member of the hoi polloi who has by accident wandered to this abandoned place – back away, lest your ignorance do your grievous harm.<br><br>You are surely asking yourself why I hid my discovery from the world, why I did not share my formula with the community of alchemists… Well, let us say I have forever been regarded as eccentric, aloof. And I have always believed it is pure chance and not men themselves that determine destiny. Furthermore, I have never sired offspring and have no desire to entrust my opus to a mere acquaintance. I thus concluded the best solution was to hide my table and trust that chance will – if my theory is correct – bring a man here who shall know how to make use of it, whom it shall delight and to whom it will prove of great use. Whether I am right or wrong – time will tell.<br><br>Use my gift wisely and fare you well,<br>Julius ban Gavh'e, alchemist

   1206366|9665dfcd||Ducal Guard's report on the death of the Beast's second victim.
   1206365|44d7ce25||The night of the Feast of Saint Nepomucen two patrons exiting the Clever Clogs Inn came across a corpse lying in the gutter. Both witnesses – Xavier and Bruno – are known to the Ducal Guard as they have previously been convicted of petty theft. Seeing the highly unusual circumstances of the deceased’s death, the witnesses informed the Ducal Guard and Guardsmen arrived on the scene in short order.<br><br>The victim was identified as Ramon du Lac, a knight errant in the ducal service. Sir du Lac was dressed in a nightgown and nightcap, with a pillow placed under his head and a bedwarmer placed in his hand. His clothing and the pillow had been soaked through by the gutter’s contents.<br><br>The victim perished as a result of being pierced through the heart by long claws. The blow was dealt with great precision. The Guardsmen searched for any fragment of a five-pointed star near the body (as was found in the case of Count Crespi), yet their search yielded no results. Witnesses Xavier and Bruno deny having taken any such item for themselves.

   1206347|ed599e7f||The Noble Alondra is widely believed to be a mythical figure. Yet thanks to a painstaking analysis of the source materials, I have been able to establish beyond all doubt that the myth has roots in true events in which Alondra, a real woman of flesh and blood, took part.<br><br>What, then, do we know about the Noble Alondra? Dressed as a man and calling herself by a false name, she served as a squire. Just before being dubbed a knight, she revealed her true identity and was forced into exile. She lived in the desert and, as the mysterious Heron Knight, defended pilgrims. She fought at the Battle of Cervantes Pass, where she was badly wounded and taken to the field hospital, where she was recognized.<br><br>We know the duke, moved by her courage, dubbed her a knight and she then became the heroine of many tales which describe the righteousness of her character and generosity of her spirit.<br><br>Alondra’s disappearance remains shrouded in mystery.  The most popular legend claims the knight was summoned by the Lady of the Lake and journeyed to the bottom of the lake to see here, where she remains to this day, as the guardian of that subterranean domain.

   1206344|70fcbc07||The last day of the tourney had come and it was now clear Gottfried would tilt against the mysterious Chessboard Knight in the joust. Gottfried was the ducal champion at the time, so all were counting on his victory. No one knew a thing about the Chessboard Knight except that he had come from the south in dark armor and had a shield bearing  sixty-four black-and-white squares.<br><br>When the herald trumpeted the signal, the knights charged at each other. Gottfried’s lance shattered against the Chessboard Knight’s shield and the mysterious knight swayed in his saddle. No mere mortal could have survived such a blow, yet the Chessboard Knight did not fall from his horse, but instead struck a blow of his own on the next pass, knocking Gottfried to the ground.<br><br>The victor approached his defeated foe, stuck out his hand and helped him stand. Before the herald could announce his victory, he took off his helm and all beheld his eyes of coal and face of burnt cinders.<br><br>”I have come from a time long passed to remind you of humility, which is a long-forgotten virtue. My name was consumed by dragon fire when I perished, victim of my own pride.”<br><br>After saying these words the Chessboard Knight rode off. No one stopped him, yet they repeat his warning to this day.
   1206351|990e248f||Victim’s body was found by guard patrol after sunset. Guardsmen recognized the deceased as Count Crespi. <br><br>Body was found on hands and knees, propped up against pillory. Corpse was already in a state of rigor mortis, which could indicate Crespi had undergone great physical exertion before death. More likely, the murderer waited for the postmortem stiffening to set in so the body would remain in the desired pose without the need for further support.<br><br>Crespi died from wounds dealt by long claws. His own sword, in its sheathe, was hung around his neck. He was clothed in attire which, according to his servants, he usually donned for suppers.<br><br>Lying on the cobblestones near the body was a five-pointed star made of gold. Nothing has been determined regarding its origin.

   1206369|df6566b0||Ducal Guard's report on the death of the Beast's third victim.
   1206368|eff81d22||News the Beast had taken a third victim was reported by a crayfish fisherman by the name of Linus. The Beast’s dismembered corpse had been found in the river’s shallows, tangled in the man’s nets. The victim was identified as Count de la Croix.<br><br>The evidence suggesting this was the Beast’s third victim were the wounds to the body’s rib cage, which were dealt by long claws and constituted the immediate cause of death. It is not known why the Beast dismembered the body. Perhaps this was a matter of staging to provoke certain connotations, as in the case of the two previous victims.<br><br>No additional objects or tracks were found near the body. Count de la Croix’s personal effects most probably were carried off by the river’s current.
   1206374|3bd88c84||There were many brave and true knights in the service of the old duke, but the greatest of them all was Luis Alberni. His crest showed a red field with a golden star, each of whose five points stood for one of the chivalric virtues.<br><br>Yet fame and glory went to Alberni’s head. Years passed and he began to think himself the most perfect of all knights. In the end, he came to think he was virtue incarnate and there was no one in the world who preceded him in this regard, something even the Lady of the Lake must recognize. Alberni thus set off to see her and have her pay him homage in honor of his excellency.<br><br>Yet as Alberni approached the Lady’s home, his body and equipment began to change. The slender knight grew more and more corpulent, until his horse could finally no longer bear him. His sword first became wooden, then turned into a mace, and his shining armor became dull and turned to ash. All he had left was his helmet, which turned into a wooden cage.<br><br>Alberni stood on the shore of the lake, wishing to speak, yet all that came from his lips was a wild cry. The knight peered at his reflection in the lake’s waters and understood he had become a giant. The Lady of the Lake then emerged and said: You abandoned the chivalric virtues long ago. Of all your sins, the greatest was pride. It has changed your sword into a mace, deprived you of armor and made your flesh into that of a beast. From now on you shall be known as Golyat. Go to Mount Gorgon, where you shall live in this form far from the eyes of men, accompanied by the painful memory of your lost glory, until the day death mercifully frees you from your torment.

   1214380|d80cfd29||Report on Knight Errantry Activities in the Duchy of Toussaint #42/g/22/ul/1271<br><br>The day of this writing saw the end of criminal enforcement activities directed against one Loth of uncertain, though certainly mixed, heritage, hence his pseudonym, Halfbreed. The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Fox Hollow – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the caves known as Tulasens. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Loth Halfbreed, wanted by writ of law in Angren and Toussaint, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 18% to take into account water use fees and immediate payment in species.

   1214224|cba8e67a||I’ve decided! I shall ask her tomorrow. A man only lives once!<br>We agreed to meet at our usual place at noon. Clarissa has asked for a half-day off, and I’ll sneak away from the chancellery. That old fogey of a supervisor will never notice I’m missing. And even if he did, so what! I’m young, I’ll find other work.<br>Although… if Clarissa found out I’d lost my job, she might not agree… I’d have proposed to her ages ago, were I not aware how much she fears a life of poverty. She’s never said as much, but I can see it worries her.<br>But what are we waiting for? Together we shall live more economically than apart, and finally we shall not have constantly to scheme up ways to meet here!<br>I wanted to invite her to dine at the best eatery in all of Beauclair… So many times I have imagined what it would be like. Waiters decked out in golden livery would bring us foie gras and sorbets. Clarissa would sit on a satin cushion, a raven-black crown of hair on her head and looking beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all the room.  Then, I would pull out a diamond ring.<br>But the truth is I shall never be able to afford all that, not even if Clarissa were to insist a ring of simple silver would be enough for her and we’d be better of spending that coin to buy a house in Hauteville, where we could open up a shop and she could sell hats.<br>Thus I shall propose to her tomorrow, in the abandoned wine cave which serves as our meeting place, our cozy sanctuary where we have spent so many pleasant hours together. She never complained that our only romantic moments have been spent surrounded by cobwebs and old barrels of wine. But tomorrow marks the end of all that! Once we are wed, I will carry her across my threshold. It will be tight quarters, but there will be room enough for a bed. And there will be no cobwebs.<br>I’ve only a simple copper ring for her, with a red glass jewel of the cheapest sort. But I promise in a year’s time I will exchange it for a silver one, with an amethyst, or maybe even a ruby!<br>O, Clarissa! Tomorrow cannot come soon enough!<br>I think I shall not be able to fall asleep tonight.

The visit had both a social and a political dimension, for the duchess was hoping Queen Calanthe would follow the dictates of international protocol and repay with a visit of her own, perferably during the above-mentioned Festival, thus gracing the celebration with her royal presence.<br><br>The ducal couple was accompanied by both daughters, Syanna and Anarietta. It is worth mentioning here that both infants are sprouting like beanpoles and it shall not belong before it will be necessary to find them husbands. In the case of the elder daughter, Syanna, this should not prove a problem, as suitors will flock from all over the civilized world for the chance to be husband to the future duchess, especially when they see her portrait, which will not even require much embellishment. Things are somewhat different in the case of young Anarietta, who is overly thin and furthermore auburn haired. The hope remains, however, that time will add to her charms.

The visit had both a social and a political dimension, for the duchess was hoping Queen Calanthe would follow the dictates of international protocol and repay with a visit of her own, perferably during the above-mentioned Festival, thus gracing the celebration with her royal presence.<br><br>The ducal couple was accompanied by their daughter, Anarietta. It is worth mentioning here that the infant is sprouting like a beanpole and it shall not belong before it will be necessary to find her a husband. Time will surely add to her charms. As for character and imagination, she is not lacking either quality in the least.

   1214669|532eeaeb||This hanse’s mighty odd. All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…<br><br>Well, we're botched. Just learned some white-haired half-man, half-monster took out Starling. Just diddling great. Now we need to get our bums out of this swamp before that freak gets us, too. If some other beast doesn't first. Without the hanse's support, tough times are ahead...

   1214482|d5b3e67a||... Holy Lebioda must have given me a kindly wink today, or perhaps it was mere chance and circumstance – the important thing is, I’ve found a cave that will make a perfect wine cellar! Production’s been going wonderfully the last few seasons and lack of storage space has become a pressing issue. I could have hired men to dig a cellar, but I’d hate to slow work on barreling the grapes, and at any rate, no dug out cellar can match a limestone cavern.<br><br>The one I found is perfect – spacious and not at all overly damp. And I came across it thoroughly by accident, while strolling among the rocks. My foot slipped into a crevasse, and when I tugged it free a few stones fell down into it. I listened for a long while before I heard them hit the bottom. I then walked around the entire slope until I finally found an entrance!<Br><br>Tomorrow we will begin turning it into a storehouse and transferring the barrels.<br><br>[Later entry, consisting of hurriedly scrawled entries] Monsters in cave. Huge centipedes. Men barely escaped. We’ll try to go again, recover what we can. Must block off all entrances. Hope no one else ever stumbles into that accursed cave…

   1054655|00000000||The play was a success. Although not the finest spectacle to ever grace the Butchers' Yard, it more than sufficed for Priscilla's purposes - Dudu attended the play and revealed himself at its end. Geralt quickly pulled him behind the curtain and began questioning him about me and Ciri. This is how the witcher learned I was a prisoner of the Church of the Eternal Fire.

   1053375|57a11068||Once part of Redania, Novigrad now has the status of a free city. It is the world's largest city and, without a doubt, the richest as well. Cradle of the cult of the Eternal Fire, it is now home to the church of the same name. It is ruled officially by the head of the church, referred to as the hierarch, though its underworld crime bosses also have a great deal of say in matters.
   1053347|f658b69b||Once upon a time Oxenfurt was a renowned university center, a capital of learning and liberty. The outbreak of war brought Redanian troops to the city, King Radovid at their head. The university dorrs were shut and locked, the students were driven out, and the entire town began to feel like an extension of the infamous prison located within its walls.

If anyone previously believed the ongoing war did not concern the free city, not a single resident now doubts the further course of the conflict will be determined within its walls. Our agents have confirmed earlier reports contending that King Radovid has important plans for Novigrad, and lately we have observed an increase in his agents' activity as well as the spread of his propaganda. His prime objective seems to be seizure of the wealth held by the Church of the Eternal Fire. Yet though Hierarch Hemmelfart officially rules the city, true power is in the hands of local crime lords. I recommend the emperor's agents focus further activity in that direction.<br><br>Henry var Attre<br><br>by decree of His Imperial Majesty<br><br>Ambassador of the Empire of Nilfgaard in the Free City of Novigrad

   1049777|00000000||The story of Hanna's disappearance had a tragic end. It turned out she had been killed by her own husband. He did not do this on purpose, however. Afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy, he would hide in the forest during his transformations in order to protect his friends and loved ones.<br><br>Hanna's sister Margaret knew this secret, and had one of her own - she was in love with Niellen and fiercely jealous of Hanna's life with him. She decided to take Hanna into the woods to watch her husband's transformation, hoping she'd then abandon him in disgust. Sadly, Hanna was careless enough to draw the werewolf's attention. Margaret was able to escape, but her sister was not so lucky. Niellen, transformed into a bloodthirsty beast, slaughtered the love of his life with his own hands.<br>
   1049716|00000000||Ciri's pursuers did not find what they were looking for. They departed empty-handed, leaving one warrior behind to tend to Geralt and Keira. He proved a weak match for the witcher and the sorceress, but their victory was bittersweet, as in the underground passageways Geralt found neither Ciri nor the elven mage. All he could now do was to follow the hints provided by yet another morphotic projection the mage had left behind.
   1049221|00000000||Those who stray off the beaten tracks in the bogs of Velen rarely live to amend their error. Even the Nilfgaardian soldiers stationed at the Army Group 'Center' camp would at times disappear in the marshes without a trace. After yet another patrol failed to return, the quartermaster of the camp posted a call for some brave soul to search them out and bring them back, or, barring that, at least determine their fate.<br>

   1050852|00000000||When Geralt entered the Novigrad bathhouse, he happened to walk in on a meeting of the heads of the city's criminal underworld. Becoming an unwitting participant in their conversation, he learned of the conflict between the triumvirate made up of the King of Beggars, Sigi Reuven and Carlo "Cleaver" Varese on the one hand, and Whoreson Junior and the unknown powers backing him on the other. Cleaver in particular wanted Whoreson gone and offered Geralt help in finding and gettin to the bastard, which suited Geralt's interests. They say hands aplenty make for light work, and Geralt had every reason to believe this applied to gang warfare as much as it did to cleaning a barn, so he graciously accepted the gangster's offer.<br>
   1050730|00000000||Every story has to start somewhere. This one starts in the guest room at Kaer Morhen, the stronghold of the witchers in the Blue Mountains. It starts with Geralt taking a bath, disproving the theory that witchers neglect personal hygiene. But as he's bathing, he is brusquely interrupted by Yennefer - does she ever interrupt in any other way? She reminds him that he was supposed to train with Ciri.

   1062471|22af4eaf||I, the undersigned George of Kagen, a witcher by trade, testify as follows.<br><br>While traveling through Velen I received a summons to provide professional testimony in the matter of the accused Bartoslav of Luvfield.<br><br>This Bartoslav stands accused of causing several shipwrecks near the lighthouse which it is his duty to keep. Ships led astray by errant signals from his lighthouse have repeatedly smashed against rocks near the shore, and the lighthouse keeper is held to be responsible for this state of affairs. During the trial Bartoslav testified that he was diligent in the fulfilment of his duties and that the accidents were caused by nightwraiths deceiving sailors with their false glow.<br><br>Having investigated the area, I can testify that I found no trace of nightwraith activity. There are likewise no signs of noonwraiths, mamunes, errnymphs or any other specters in the habit of misleading weary travelers journeying by foot, sea or horse.<br><br>I did, however, find the catastrophes’ true cause. They were not the fault of the nightwraiths blamed by the accused, but neither were they the fault of the lighthouse keeper himself. The accidents were caused by local hooligans who have taken to lighting fires on the hill at night and then robbing the ships that subsequently wreck upon the shore. I was put on their trail by Bartoslav’s son, who showed me the ashes from their misleading fires.<br><br>My testimony shows that the lighthouse keeper Bartoslav of Luvfield is not guilty of the crimes of which he stands accused and should be freed. I also humbly ask for the bailiff to put the lighthouse keeper and his family under his protection, for in light of the revelations Bartoslav’s son led me to discover, there will surely be certain parties with cause for vengeance. I cannot undertake the task of protecting the family myself, for I have accepted a contract to kill a dragon said to be lurking atop the Crookback Hills and so must return there posthaste to kill the beast and complete my task.<br><br>Signed: George of Kagen, witcher<br>Transcribed by Vicenzo Stock, marshal to the royal prefecture in Gors Velen

   1061984|9ee17bbd||Human life requires three things for its sustenance - food, drink and gossip. It is thus no wonder that no matter where I travel, be it ice-bound Poviss or ever green Toussaint, everyone asks me about the passions that bind Geralt and the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. As a man both cautious and discreet, I refuse to betray their secrets - with one important exception. The history of their first encounter is so extraordinary, so romantic and moving, that it would be a veritable crime to hide its light beneath a bushel basket. Indeed, had I not witnessed these events in person, I would never believe there was room in our grim and dark world for such fantastic marvels.<br><br>It all began when Geralt and I were feeling a bit peckish and, unburdened by heavy coin pouches, decided to fish our supper out of a lake. No bites were to be had, but we did not leave empty-handed - my hook snagged quite a lovely little pot. Oblivious to my friend's warnings, I opened it - and in doing so freed a powerful djinn.<br><br>Without giving it much thought I set about proclaiming my wishes. Before I could get to three, however, the djinn - irritated, I see now in hindsight, at being issued demands so soon after waking - began to throttle me. Geralt was able to drive him off, but I was left in a sorry state. I acted, the witcher told me later, as though under the influence of some curse. Clearly, the help of an expert in the magic arcana would be needed.<br><br>It was our good fortune that Yennefer of Vengerberg happened to be staying in a nearby village. Geralt went to her to ask that she heal his best friend, who happened also to be the brightest star in the North's poetic firmament. Yennefer, however, was more interested in the djinn (which she wanted to trap into magic servitude) than in its victim, and, it should be said, played the witcher like a well-strung mandolin. Yet rather than grow angry at being used in such a calculating manner, he fell white head over muddy boots in love with her.<br><br>What happened then… well, I won't go into details, suffice to say that Yennefer's plans hardly delighted the djinn, and without its cooperation she proved unable to tame it. The sorceress would surely have met a tragic end - and taken all of Rinde along with her - had Geralt not rushed to her rescue. For once, he did not need to draw either of his blades: to send the djinn packing, he had but to pronounce the third and final wish. He could have asked for anything: wealth, fame, power… but instead he asked the djinn to bind his fate to that of the arrogant yet intriguing sorceress from Vengerberg.<br><br>Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, born 1232.

   1061789|99d66d40||<i>Childhood and Early Manhood</i><br><br>Though the Nilfgaardian throne was his by right of birth, it would be many long years before Emhyr var Emreis sat upon it. When he was but thirteen, an uprising engulfed the empire’s capital. A usurper seized power, overthrowing Emhyr’s father, Fergus var Emreis, who then refused to grant legitimacy to the coup. The usurper then decided he would break Fergus by having mages torture his son and heir, Emhyr. He failed in his plan, was forced to kill Fergus, and Emhyr escaped, presumably to a land beyond the empire's borders.<br><br>No reliable accounts of the emperor's actions in exile exist. Some claim he fell into the company of a knight errant, serving as his squire. This seems plausible enough, though the tales about the eccentric knight's proclivity to charge at windmills must surely be storytellers' exaggerations. A few unreliable reports claim a connection between Emhyr and the fabled Urcheon of Erlenwald who saved the life of King Roegner of Cintra. This seems far less likely, for it is public record that when the witcher Geralt of Rivia lifted the Urcheon's curse, he was revealed to be a duke named Duny, who later wed Roegner's daughter, Pavetta, and perished at her side when their ship went down at sea.<br><br>What is known for certain is that around the time of this great tragedy for the kingdom of Cintra, Emhyr reappeared in the empire and led a revolt to overthrow the usurper and restore his own birthright. Soon after he led the empire's armies in their successful conquest of Cintra, setting a tone of determined military expansion that would endure through the rest of his reign.
   1061810|0b1524e1||The Second War against Nilfgaard
   1061808|7fef2684||War with Nilfgaard first broke out in 1263 - its immediate cause a clear act of aggression by Nilfgaard against Cintra. The Imperial Army crossed the Amell Mountains and attacked Cintra's southern border posts near the forest known as Erlenwald. There are unverified claims of Emhyr var Emreis having a special attachment for this place - their import, however, remains unknown. What is certain is that he long ago staked an unfounded claim to control over all Cintra.<br><br>The decisive battle of the conflict took place in the Marnadal Valley. There Nilfgaard surrounded and decimated Cintra’s forces led by the royal couple. King Eist Tuirseach fell in the battle. The survivors, led by Queen Calanthe, sought shelter in the capital, yet none was to be found there. The city was overrun, its population massacred, and Queen Calanthe preferred to take her own life rather than surrender to the invaders.<br><br>The theater of war then shifted to Upper Sodden, where acts of terror and barbarous cruelty were perpetrated. Historical consensus holds that the Imperial Army's bestial acts here propelled the North to victory during the so-called Second Battle of Sodden. The atrocities had left the northern forces with only two options: to win the war, or to die with their families. Desperate determination thus drove them to defeat the seemingly invincible Nilfgaardians. The next year, in 1264, an armistice was signed which ceded control of Cintra to the empire, making it the northernmost province of Nilfgaard in all but name.
   1061814|8de4bdcb||Unlike in the First War against Nilfgaard, there was no clear aggressor at the start of the second conflict. In early 1267 the kings of the North met at Hagge to prepare a plan for Cintra's reconquest. Foreseeing their intentions, Emperor var Emreis amassed a large expeditionary force on the Temerian border. He then masterminded a series of events that left the North ripe for invasion - a mages' revolt erupted on Thanedd Island, and Redania descended into chaos after King Vizimir was assassinated. All Emhyr needed now was a pretext, which he got when supposedly Aedirnian soldiers attacked the Nilfgaardian frontier fortress known as Glevitzingen. Armed with this excuse, Nilfgaardian forces marched north and thus began the second war.<br><br>During the war's first phase, the imperial offensive quickly swept across the North. The empire's army started by occupying southern Lyria. Rivia was next to fall, after a short siege. Then came the Battle of Aldersberg, followed by Menno Coehoorn's march into Vengerberg. King Henselt of Kaedwen seized this opportunity to dismember his neighbor and promptly signed a treaty with Nilfgaard partitioning Aedirn between them. Opportunistic elves also joined the empire's cause and for their trouble gained an independent realm in Dol Blathanna. King Foltest was the next rat to scurry from the sinking ship, signing a truce with Nilfgaard and grabbing for himself a portion of western Aedirn. Abandoned by his allies and left with the rump of his kingdom, Demavend, ruler of Aedirn, fled to seek shelter in Redania.<br><br>The war's first stage ended and its second stage began when Nilfgaard broke its truce with Temeria after a mere fortnight and two days. Its forces immediately entered Brugge and Sodden, and soon both lands were awash in blood. In short order Emhyr occupied all of southern Temeria and shattered Foltest’s troops at Maribor. The shrewd emperor then retreated for the winter to Sodden, where he prepared for a renewed offensive come spring.<br><br>No war in history saw such fierce battles as were waged during the great Temerian offensive undertaken over those fair spring days. The forces of the North, united at last, proved a worthy opponent and slowed the Nilfgaardian advance. This provided Emhyr's internal enemies with an opening to set in motion a plot designed to depose him. Weakened by the infighting (known as the Conspiracy of Nobles), the myth of its invincibility shattered, Nilfgaard then saw its mightiest army routed by northern forces near Brenna. The tide of war had clearly turned.<br><br>Thus began the war's fourth and final phase. The North embarked on a counter-offensive, forcing the Imperial Army into a slow and bloody retreat. It was only a matter of time before armistice talks began, temporary truce lines were drawn, and the war drew to a close. Delegates from all parties to the conflict convened in Cintra to draft a peace treaty and establish a new world order. On the 2nd of April, 1268, the Peace of Cintra was signed, bringing to an end the Second War against Nilfgaard.
   1061823|862df541||Temeria… a land where milk and honey once flowed. In what did she wrong the gods that they should treat her so cruelly? The Pearl of the North to some, she proved a galloping range for Nilfgaardian cavalry to others. As a country it had survived two previous wars against the empire. It was here that the wars' bloodiest battles were fought. It was in Temeria where their most bestial deeds were wrought. It was Temerian civilians who bore the full brunt of these wars' horrors.<br><br>And bear them we did, bravely and steadfastly, until the demise of our great protector - King Foltest. Then providence turned its fickle face from Temeria. Murdered most treacherously, Foltest failed to leave Temeria a worthy successor.<br><br>And so all manner of cur soon fell upon her, tearing her apart like so much carrion. She had no more allies, then. None remembered that we had once been the armor protecting the North from the designs of the mad Dancer, he who had the gravestones of his foes pounded into a ballroom floor.<br><br>A free and independent Temeria is no more. A dark-faced sun looms over her every rampart. Yet we Temerians live on. And always will. As long as folk believe, the usurper who took our beloved capital, Vizima, to treat as his property will forever peer over his shoulder in fear. For in the shadows lurks not one dagger, but the power of a nation of daggers, waiting to deal justice’s blow.

   1061792|8a55e082||Responsibility for the outbreak of the first war (1263-1264) lies wholly with the Temerian Special Forces. Intercepted documents clearly show that Temeria intended to annex Cintra and moved in this direction, dealing a brazen blow to the balance of power that the Empire could not abide. Only by moving its forces into Cintra and establishing order there could the Empire preempt the Temerians’ destructive actions and safeguard peace. Sadly, the North, stubborn and short-sighted as ever, chose armed conflict over reasonable compromise.<br><br>During this conflict the forces of the Northern Realms perpetrated unpardonable atrocities, for which reprisals came first with the Battle of the Marnadal Valley and then with the Cintrian Incident. Our Imperial Majesty, Emhyr var Emreis, expressed his sympathies in a letter to the Cintrian court, adding that he hoped such horrors would never need to be repeated.<br><br>Once Cintra was taken, Nilfgaard considered the situation in the North stabilized, yet the Northern Realms fought on, bringing the situation to a head with the clash near Sodden. Nordling propaganda depicts this battle as the turning point of the war. In truth it had no political significance whatever. Shortly afterwards an armistice was signed, rendering Cintra a vassal of the Empire of Nilfgaard for all eternity.

   1061797|d055438d||The Empire and the North crossed swords again in 1267 to 1268. Following an eruption of mage treachery on Thanedd Island, Nilfgaard could not sit idly by while the North let magic sow destruction freely. The Imperial Army took Lyria at lightning speed, meeting with little resistance. After short sieges, our forces marched into Rivia and Vengerberg, greeted each time by jubilant crowds thirsty for peace and civilization. We then moved against Aedirn.<br><br>(…) King Demavend’s attempt to stop the Golden Sun’s triumphant march failed, and his forces were pushed back to the Pontar Valley and Dol Blathanna.<br><br>(…) Queen Meve began to format guerilla bands made up of bandits and outlaws, of which the North has never been short.<br><br>(…) In a display of typical Nordling treachery, King Henselt signed a truce with the Empire behind his allies’ backs, resulting in Aedirn being promptly partitioned.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty, in an act of supreme benevolence, created an elven state in Dol Blathanna, thus forging a bulwark of tolerance against the abhorrent racist laws of the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) King Foltest of Temeria signed a truce with the Empire. Yet this Nordling’s word proved to have as much value as the snow melting in the fields that spring. The truce held a mere sixteen days before it was violated. Foltest’s stupidity led to the Slaughter of Brugge, and then to a number of bloody battles in the Yaruga Valley. Faced with senseless and uncontrolled violence, the Imperial Army's leadership took it upon itself to tamp the bloodshed and ordered a retreat to Sodden.<br><br>Sadly, Foltest’s greed meant that hostilities resumed with the coming of spring. They culminated with the Battle of Brenna, where our heroic regiments faced a combined Temerian-Redanian force. To this day the North considers said battle a turning point in the war. There is no point debating this conviction. Far more important is the fact that this battle saw two strategies confronted: an honorable one, presented by the Imperial Army’s leadership, and one of trickery and subterfuge, conducted by the Nordlings.<br><br>(…) His Imperial Majesty realized the direction the conflict had taken. The Northern armies employed scorched-earth tactics, caring not at all for the pain they inflicted on civilian populations. Disgusted and unwilling to take part in this type of war, Nilfgaard withdrew its armies south. The Nordlings mistakenly saw this as an admission of defeat.<br><br>(…) Through the Emperor’s mediation, an armistice was drawn up and eventually signed in Cintra, putting an end to the Second Northern War.
   1061803|eda9be4c||Emhyr var Emreis rules to expand. He has trained his strategic brilliance on a singular vision - to conquer the world, though he rightly calls this not conquest, but salvation. Yes. The emperor of Nilfgaard sets the world alight with the torch of civilization.<br><br>Trampling the still-warm corpses of his father's usurpers, the emperor seized the throne and began to assimilate the Northern Realms, one after the other. Terror engulfed the North. Only the Battle of Brenna slowed the Imperial Army's march toward victory. A temporary peace then took hold, though none believed this mirage would last. Emhyr’s aim, to make the entire North a vassal of Nilfgaard, remained unchanged. Emhyr used peace as a cover to intensify his political efforts. Now all can see their results - chaos and disorder devour the Nordlings’ states. Ridden with internal bickering and backstabbing, they near collapse. Only a strong ruler can grapple this dysfunction into function. Only a wise ruler can give vision to their blindness. Only Emhyr var Emreis can save the North. So our armies have again crossed the Yaruga - for the third and final time…

   1061842|00000000||As it turned out, Radovid's plan was for Whoreson to start a gang war in Novigrad. In the resulting chaos, Radovid would take control of the city with ease.<br>
   1061841|00000000||Whoreson's audacity had a very specific cause - King Radovid, who had commissioned the gangster's actions.<br>
   1061840|00000000||Cyprian also took after his father in terms of ambition. He broke the unwritten armistice between Novigrad's various criminal groups and tried to murder the other three leading underworld bosses.<br>
   1061850|00000000||This spy's life story would make for a positively enthralling adventure tale. A victim of Philippa Eilhart's intrigues, he had been forced to flee Redania at breakneck speed - or have his own neck broken by assassins. For a certain time he sought refuge in far-off lands, but in the end he decided to return to the Free City of Novigrad.<br>
   1061849|00000000||Though he did not show it, in his own way Dijkstra respected Geralt - even though the very thought of their last meeting brought a pained grimace to his face. The two had found themselves standing in each other's way during the coup on Thanedd Island. The stalemate was quickly broken when Geralt summarily broke Dijkstra's leg.<br>
   1061848|00000000||The individual masquerading as Sigi Reuven was in fact none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, the former head of Redanian intelligence and a man Geralt and I had had many dealings with in the past.<br><br>He had fallen out of King Radovid's favor and nothing had been heard of him for many years. Now it seemed he had finally decided to emerge from the shadows, but instead of returning to high political wrangling he dove deep into the criminal underground - and quickly surfaced as one of its leading figures.<br>
   1061839|00000000||Cyprian Wiley the younger was one of Novigrad's most dangerous criminals. He had inherited his father's casinos, fighting ring and brothels – as well as the old man's sadistic tendencies, ruthlessness and lack of scruples.<br><br>These traits had made the moniker "Whoreson" something of a family heirloom for his powerful criminal clan.<br>
   1061875|3123eb57||(…) Which brings us to the epithet of the current ruler of Redania - “the Stern.” Allow me to diagnose the causes and consequences of this appellation.<br><br>Firstly, the seeds of Radovid’s Sternness were surely planted in his childhood. When Radovid was born to King Vizimir and Queen Hedwig in 1255, his care was immediately entrusted to Philippa Eilhart, the court sorceress. While none dared question if she was fit for the role of tutor, few now envisage her as having been a warm caregiver to a young child - and whatever harsh lessons she gave Radovid clearly left a lasting mark.<br><br>The next step on Radovid’s path to becoming the Stern? The death of his father when Radovid was but 13 years of age. Though rumor has it father and son barely knew one another, the mere fact of being thrust into one’s inheritance at such an early age and in such murky circumstances must have had a hardening effect.<br><br>Finally, the regency finished schooling Radovid towards becoming the Stern. Led by Sigismund Dijkstra of Tretogor, the Regency Council imparted upon Radovid a style of politics seeped in Dijkstra's aggressive, no-holds-barred, reason-of-state-first principles.<br><br>Such are the causes of Radovid’s temperament - now on to the consequences. Most manifestations of his fierce manner are well known, however, a few illustrative examples might prove useful here. They include his summoning of the Order of the Flaming Rose to be his armed enforcers, his later support for the witch hunters in their zealous cause, and finally, there is the massacre at Loc Muinne…<br><br>Yet it is in the fight against Nilfgaard that Radovid has proven himself truly the Stern. While the forces of other realms disintegrated in the face of the empire’s onslaught, he has strengthened his own realm and taken command of the joint armies of the North. Whatever their opinion of him before, all clear-eyed observers now agree: Radovid V, known also as Radovid the Stern, is the North’s last bulwark against Emhyr’s expanding power.

Black has swarmed over our sweet Temerian soil, like ants swarming a drop of honey fallen in their path. Emhyr’s cutthroats adore their master and long to emulate his desecrations. The Nilfgaardian onslaught will spare no one. Under its sun-adorned banners hide dark hordes, cackling with anticipation, gleefully practicing how they will prance on the graves of our elders, women and children alike…<br><br>Good folk of the North! The time has come to unite! Forget our past feuds and quarrels! There is but one foe, one despicable to us all! Let us spare no blood, for each drop spilled might save the life of a brothers.<br><br>Yet is there any man who will not yield before their frightful charge, before that mass clad in plate black as pitch and stinking of the blood of the raped and murdered…?<br><br>I tell you there is, brothers and sisters. There is one man whom the loathsome foe frightens not one bit. A man who, armed with wisdom, courage and cunning, can give fight to the southern plague. That man's name is Radovid V. The Stern, they call him, and in this we are blessed, for only such a man can turn back the deluge of iron and steel, send it rushing back whence it came.<br><br>Mothers, weep not for your sons! Death for a noble cause is an honor every man should embrace.

   1061884|00000000||Not for the first time Geralt showed what a babe in the wilderness he was in matters involving the fairer sex. For while I can say from experience that there are indeed women who will willingly share a man with their best friend, when trying that with women to whom one has declared true and undying love, things tend to turn out differently.<br><br>Toying with Triss' feelings ended in humiliation for Geralt - a fate which, I must admit, he thoroughly deserved.<br>
   1061871|dd61ca57||Redania is a kingdom belonging to the so-called League of Northern States. It is located between the Buina and Pontar rivers, bordered by Temeria to the south and Kovir and Caingorn to the north. To its east lies Kaedwen, and to its southeast - Aedirn. Its capital is Tretogor, yet the land's most famous cities are Oxenfurt, home to the enclave of culture and learning that is the Oxenfurt Academy, and Novigrad, which, while a free city, stands on Redanian soil.<br><br>The cult of the nobility runs strong in Redania. That social stratum possesses more privileges here than in any nearby realm. Great differences in wealth exist among the gentry, but Redanian law cares for birth not property, making a well-born beggar the legal equal of the richest magnate. Those of high birth and great wealth draw the latter primarily from the grain trade and pedigreed horse husbandry. This last the Redanians excel at, outdoing all other nations - Redanian steeds are unsurpassed. The Redanian cavalry is thus among the best formations of its kind in the world, and with the country's nobility filling its ranks it is the heart of the Redanian armed forces. As a consequence of the nobility's privileged position, the peasantry is treated worse here than in neighboring realms, and only the king’s iron fist keeps them from rebelling.<br><br>The Redanian army consists of thirty-five thousand armed men, which number includes a core of four thousand elite knights. Soon after the outbreak of the Third War against Nilfgaard, Redania’s forces were further supplemented with Temerian and Kaedweni regiments, as well as with mercenary troops from Poviss and Kovir. Indeed, one can now accurately speak of a united army of the North led by King Radovid V.<br><br>The Redanian treasury relies on the profitable trade with Novigrad to fill its coffers, with wheat as the chief staple crop and main commodity. Redania has it in abundance, thus the country is oft called the granary of the North, its landscape consisting almost entirely of rolling waves of grain. Yet despite the land's natural bounty, Redania's economy has been in crisis since war with Nilfgaard broke out once more. The tumult and desperation has led in recent days to the cult of the Eternal Fire gaining more and more adherents.

They then went through an ordeal together: the first round of selections, the murderous Changes, the Trial of the Grasses, and training on the Gauntlet - the witchers’ daunting obstacle course. They also received hidings together for more than one act of childish delinquency. When they became adults, they walked the Path separately, but still reconvened at Kaer Morhen nearly every winter to wait out the cold, drink to their successes and remember fallen comrades.<br><br>Though Eskel never gained Geralt’s renown, he equaled the White Wolf in experience and carried out his contracts with care and efficiency.

His father, King Vizimir, was murdered when Radovid was quite young, and his mother, Hedwig of Malleore, and a Regency Council ruled in his stead.<br><br>Young Radovid soon seized power in his own right, however, and wrought vengeance on those who had treated him with disrespect. He took to forcing all his potential political opponents to swear allegiance – or face death.<br><br>He waged war not only against Nilfgaard, but also against mages, whom he saw as the root of all evil. Radovid also made every effort to gain control over the Free City of Novigrad, whose fleet and treasury could tip the scales of the ongoing conflict in his favor.<br>
   1061629|00000000||Radovid burned with particularly intense hostility (first kindled in his early childhood) for the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Rumors spoke of a special torture regimen he had prepared just for her. And while the two dozen points they mentioned were surely an exaggeration, they accurately conveyed the general scale of his hatred.<br>
   1061628|00000000||Geralt's meeting with Radovid confirmed the rumors circulating about the king's mental state. The Redanian monarch was a dangerous madman trapped in his own world of disturbing visions. This did not make him one jot less intelligent or cunning, however.<br><br>Despite his mental afflictions, the young king was manipulating his opponents like a highly skilled puppet master.<br>
   1061602|00000000||The wave of religious and racially-motivated killings that swept through Novigrad in the spring of 1272 coincided with Hubert Rejk's term as coroner at the city morgue.<br><br>Because of this he was overworked and additionally had to bear the harassment of his dislikeable superior, Reverend Nathaniel. It is thus no surprise that he came across as unpleasant and sarcastic when Geralt and he first met.<br><br>Furthermore, it was clear there was bad blood between him and Joachim von Gratz, a fact that did little to improve the already rather stiff atmosphere at the morgue. Nevertheless, having learned the reason for Geralt's unexpected visit, Hubert made it clear Geralt and Joachim could count on his help.<br>
   1061611|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.<br>
   1061609|00000000||It seemed the surgeon was no stranger to violence, for he bore a formidable scar worthy of a veteran of the Battle of Brenna.<br>
   1061608|00000000||We met Joachim von Gratz, chief surgeon at Vilmerius Hospital, in very unfortunate circumstances. My Priscilla had been attacked and he was tending to her wounds.<br><br>I must admit I was so shaken I hardly remember our first meeting, save that he was a cool-headed doctor who seemed to know a great deal about the previous murders and offered his help investigating the matter.<br>
   1061612|00000000||It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, Hubert Rejk, who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue. When asked why, von Gratz explained that, thirty years earlier, Hubert had denounced him to the authorities for his political activities.<br>
   1061146|00000000||Though the youngest of the three Crones, the Weavess was not one jot less ugly or evil than her older sisters. It was she who wove their magic tapestries of human hair gathered as tribute from the young children of nearby villages during their "cutting" ceremonies. These tapestries were how the worshipers of the Ladies of the Wood made contact with and paid homage to their deities.<br>
   1061150|00000000||During the Crones' sabbath it turned out the sisters truly did feed on human flesh, cooking it up in infernal pots and spicing it with root from the cursed tree growing atop Bald Mountain.<br>
   1061149|00000000||The Crone known as Brewess was the middle of the three demonic sisters in terms of age - but the first in terms of size. Brewess was said to be a master concocter of magical mixtures, and, in the more ghastly legends, was said to know over a dozen different recipes for human soup.<br>
   1061123|00000000||Young Hjalborn was the nephew of Holger Blackhand, the jarl of Faroe, and one of the claimants to Skellige's crown.<br><br>Despite his young age he had already managed to achieve some renown, both during overseas raids and while fighting the monsters dwelling in the dangerous regions of the archipelago.  His deeds had earned him enough fame, name-recognition and treasure that he stood a good chance of being elected king.<br>
   1061122|00000000||Hjalborn
   1061154|00000000||Yet no magic, however old, could save her from Cirilla's wrath.
   1061153|00000000||The Crones of Velen were not just old – they were literally ancient, having been around since the reign of the first human kings and possibly even since the coming of the elves.<br><br>Of the three ghastly sisters, the Whispess was most ancient, or at least so claimed the swamp dwellers' whispered legends. Whispered, for if they spoke too loudly the Crone would hear it – for she demanded tribute in the form of human ears, which she hung from trees and through which, using primeval magic, she heard all that happened in the swamp.<br>
   1061156|00000000||Reverend Nathaniel, supervisor of the city morgue and cleric of the Church of the Eternal Fire, was a man with a vile character - and a stormy past. Before donning the frock he had served for years as the city torturer.<br><br>One would be hard pressed to find a more inferior candidate for a pastor than a former hangman - but, as the saying goes, in Novigrad anything is possible.<br>
   1060987|00000000||It can be difficult for a woman to gain the esteem of knights and warriors not accustomed to seeing female hands on the reins of power. It helps little when, like Birna, widow of King Bran of Skellige, the woman seeking power is filled with acrid disdain for her countrymen and their customs. One might argue that disdain is a valid reaction when, in the case of the passing of a man of power who embodies tradition, those customs call on her to follow long since outdated ritual and cast herself on her husband's funeral pyre.<br><br>Justified or not, Birna's desire to rewrite age-old Skellige traditions put her at odds with the jarls and made it unlikely she would be remembered alongside Calanthe of Cintra or Meve of Lyria as a successful and revered ruler.<br>

   1063278|79f9d0ca||Day 1.<br>Luckily the teleport deposited us directly in my laboratory. It’s good to be home. I had grown sick to the gills of that leaky tub. I hope that storm I summoned smashed it into those craggy rocks off the Grassy Knoll shore.<br><br>The experiments which my students conducted on drowners in my absence did not yield the expected results. As usual, I must do everything myself.<br><br>I will administer a brew of medicinal opium to the subject. This “milk of the poppy” will keep the witcher in a state of half-consciousness, and thus incapable of any resistance. Commencing studies.<br><br>Note: I must hold off on my planned experiments while I clear up the demolished portion of my laboratory. I have set the bones in the forearm of one of my assistants. I will now administer a quadruple dose of “milk of the poppy” to the witcher.<br><br>Day 4.<br>Subject shows incredible resistance to physical torture. Only broke after the second day of intense labor. Moderately satisfactory results from the interrogation. Garnered information about witcher training and the Cat School of witchers in general. As I suspected, the Cat School witchers are for the most part of elven stock. This school must have some tie to the Elder Races (addendum: perhaps its founder was a member of the Aen Seidhe?<br><br>Subject unfit for further study. I have discontinued his doses of poppy.<br><br>Day 7.<br>Administered extract of cowbane and hemlock. In typical representatives of the human and Aen Seidhe species such a mixture provokes paralysis of the peripheral nervous system, and eventually of the nerve endings as well. This results in muscular, skeletal, pulmonary and cardiac paralysis, and ultimately death through suffocation.<br><br>The witcher is not, however, a typical representative of any species. Though the poison did seem to cause some mild irritation (sic!) in his nervous system, his mutated body quickly managed to neutralize the harmful alkaloids.<br><br>In a matter of hours all symptoms of the poison I administered have vanished.<br><br>Day 15.<br>Stinging him with sea wasp toxin did not provoke the expected results. In order to strengthen the toxin’s effect I have poured ethyl alcohol into his wounds. His nervous system seems to be immune.<br><br>Day 26.<br>The subject has been tortured, poisoned, burnt, frozen, starved and dehydrated, and despite it all his body continues to function. He eats and drinks by himself, moves about his cell on his own and is able to articulate simple words (“please”, “drink”, “don’t hurt”, “stop”).<br><br>Conclusion: as I suspected the witcher is a superb energumen! A demon trapped in such an excellently prepared body will become death incarnate, vengeful wrath made flesh – and placed at my command. No one has succeeded in creating a being of such power since the times of Malaspin and Alzur.<br><br>This is a great day for science!<br><br>Time to begin the incantations.
   1058711|00000000||In exchange for information about Cirilla, the baron asked Geralt to find his wife, Anna, and their daughter Tamara. Both had disappeared without a trace some time ago, and Phillip was slowly losing hope of ever seeing them again. Under these circumstances, a witcher was a gift from the gods.<br>
   1058710|00000000||His treatment of children and young women, towards whom he demonstrated a wholly sincere, near fatherly-concern, likewise contradicted his bandit-like appearance and terrifying moniker. Ciri had learned this for herself, finding care and shelter under his roof.<br>
   1058709|00000000||During his first encounter with "Baron" Phillip Strenger, Geralt found the man's many contradictions puzzling. This former Temerian soldier was clearly an opportunist who, after his army's resounding defeat, served, dealt and negotiated with the occupying Empire of Nilfgaard. The local peasantry anointed him the "Bloody Baron," a clear indication that he did not handle his vassals with kid gloves. On the other hand, he proved a surprisingly gracious host to an unexpected guest who was also a stranger and a hired monster slayer.<br>
   1058746|00000000||The baron’s daughter, Tamara, had disappeared with her mother some time before Geralt arrived at Crow's Perch. The baron described her as a charming young maid of nineteen summers and the apple of his eye. No wonder, then, that the lord of Crow's Perch was desperate to find her.<br>
   1058745|70710c11||It came as a surprise to many when, a mere three years after the Second War against Nilfgaard - the war which, it was said, “would end all wars” - the empire’s forces once again invaded the North. To the perceptive student of history, however, this development was not at all surprising - Nilfgaard’s economy and political system have for decades relied on expansion and conquest for continued survival.<br><br>Attentive analysis shows that Nilfgaard never abandoned its plan to subjugate the North. Contrary to popular belief, imperial diplomats, and not sorceresses, were behind the death of King Foltest. They also brought about the crisis during the summit of mages and monarchs at Loc Muinne. The current conflict is thus the result of cold calculation and long-term planning. Before the wax had time to dry on the Peace of Cintra, Emhyr var Emreis had already begun to prepare for the next war, which ultimately broke out in the spring of 1270.<br><br>The war's first stage went exactly as the emperor had planned. In a matter of months Lyria, Aedirn and Temeria found themselves in the shadow of the black banner. If not for the early frosts of December 1270 and the daring of King Radovid - who, instead of concentrating his forces on the Pontar, invaded Kaedwen thereby doubling his territory and strength - all the North would surely now be but another province in the vast Empire of Nilfgaard.
   1058749|69bf4792||Kovir and Poviss are without a doubt the richest realms in the North. Few today remember that this was not always the case, yet their poverty was once literally on everyone’s lips, in the form of now-antiquated common sayings. As recently as in the days of Heribert the Quarrelsome, one spoke of a particularly impoverished person as being “poorer than a mouse from Poviss,” called bone broth “Koviri delight” and referred to beggars as “praxedes,” after the bay along the shores of which these kingdoms lie.<br><br>Similarly, few remember that a mere handful of generations ago Kovir and Poviss were still a part of Redania. King Radovid I, known as Radovid the Great, handed dominion over them to his hated brother, Troyden, with one stipulation - that he never leave his newly-acquired demesne and not interfere in matters of state.<br><br>Handing over this rocky scrap of far-northern ground (where, the saying went, the year had two seasons - August and winter) was naturally meant as a cruel joke, a slap in the face for the over-ambitious Troyden.<br><br>Yet time soon proved that Radovid the Great had made a grave error. Before long it was discovered that Kovir's bare rocks hid priceless treasure in the form of enormous deposits of precious metals and rock salt. This discovery in turn led to tremendous growth in productive industry. Mills, forges and workshops sprouted up like mushrooms after a hearty rain.<br><br>Radovid III decided to correct his famous forebear's mistake and take back the northern frontiers of his kingdom. He was convinced the combined armies of Redania and its then-ally Kaedwen would quickly bring this ever more audacious vassal in line. History took a different turn, however, and Kovir won a resounding, crushing victory. Radovid III was forced to sign the First Treaty of Lan Exeter, granting Kovir independence while binding it to eternal neutrality - a promise Troyden’s successors have kept with great diligence.<br><br>Until recently Kovir was ruled by Esterad Thyssen, a king as wise as he was greedy. Yet his untimely demise did not stop his lands from continuing to develop and blossom. Koviri metallurgists proudly compete with the best Mahakam can offer, and many believe the University of Lan Exeter long ago surpassed the famous Oxenfurt Academy as the leading seat of higher learning in the North. And so it has come to pass that, over the course of a few generations, the inhabitants of Kovir and Poviss have turned from paupers into princes, from beggars into bankers.
   1058724|00000000||They say a man's true nature is revealed in times of crisis. The baron's reunion with his wife was certainly such a time - her deplorable state shook Phillip to the core. Yet when he learned there was a sliver of hope that Anna could be cured of her madness, the baron seized that thought with all his strength and decided to ride with his wife to the very end of the known world, to the Blue Mountains, and seek help for her tortured mind there.<br>

   1058761|836690cb||Sad as it may be, to many in our time the word "elf" is a synonym for pauper, bandit or layabout. "She-elf" is used by many to denote a prostitute or woman of loose morals. The adjective "elven," in turn, describes damaged, needlessly complicated or useless goods. Statistics, for their part, show that one in three elves living in Redania has spent time in prison, and a full one half of them have been fined at least once. The average lifespan of elves, though still thrice that of humans, grows shorter each year.<br><br>Given the above it is easy to forget that elves - or Aen Seidhe, as they fashion themselves - were once a proud race that ruled the lands stretching from the banks of the Great Sea in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and from the Dragon Mountains in the North to the Mahakam range in the south. The ruins of their cities scattered throughout the known world bear witness to their former might (cp. “Monumenta Elforum” by Istredd of Aedd Gynvael).<br>Many of the most outstanding mages, artists and poets of recorded history have been of this race. And we have elves to thank for dozens of ingenuous items we rely on each day, from screw pumps to cosmetics.<br>Those elves who dwell amongst men have largely forgotten their history and culture - the sole sliver of elven identity left in them being a burning hatred for humans, whom they refer to as <i>dh’oine</i>. The elves of Dol Blathanna, that puppet vassal of Nilfgaard, and of the wild highlands of the Blue Mountains have retained much of the old knowledge and culture, though they, too, are condemned to perish. This death sentence was handed to them by biology - for men, though short-lived, are several times more fertile than elves. Thus, while the Aen Seidhe's numbers continue to dwindle, ours grow at an alarming and ever-increasing rate.<br>Some elves believe that the tide of events can be turned, that they can put a stop to human expansion and, ultimately, to their oppression by men. They look to their mythical cousins for salvation - to the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk. The Aen Elle are said to dwell in another world or possibly another plane to which they traveled during the mythic Age of Migration, and from which they at times journey to visit our world. Legend claims a gate between the worlds could be opened, allowing the Aen Elle to ride to their downtrodden brethren's rescue. These are, however, mere fables, naïve fairy tales this race condemned to extinction uses to provide itself small comfort in these, their last, sad moments.

The kind who live according to the gods' laws, and nature's laws, too. Those disgusted by the machinations of witches, magickers and nonhumans. All that separates us from common folk is that we've the courage to take up arms, to defend our lands from evil, to slice out the gangrene that eats us from within.<br><br>We haven't a leader.

We will give you board, lodging and a weapon. We will explain how to spot the tell-tale signs of evil - birthmarks in strange and arcane shapes, smooth skin on a matron aged more than thirty springs, and black cats kept in the yard, to name but a few. We will show you how to defend yourself from witchcraft, how to tame and snuff out magic elements with dimeritium. We will instruct you how to squeeze the sinners' darkest secrets out of them with a hot iron, and how to grant them cleansing death with the help of sacred fire.
   1058808|00000000||Graden was one of the witch hunters in King Radovid's service. Unlike a great many of his comrades, he came across as a level-headed fellow, one free of prejudice, at least in his dealings with witchers.<br>

   1057884|8d07478e||Legend states that Clan Brokvar, based on the isle of Spikeroog, was founded by Sove. This hero took as his wife the lovely yet extremely quarrelsome Ulula. He tried countless ways to tame her, but no matter what lengths he went to, he could not get along with her. Finally he sailed to Hindarsfjall to meditate in Hindar, the hallowed grove. Hemdall and Freya took pity on him and gave him the formula for a potion that would grant him Understanding. They also instructed him to take a new approach, do something he had never done before, to resolve his conflicts with his wife. In order to gather the required ingredients, Sove had to kill a monster, climb the highest mountain in the isles and dive into the deepest undersea chasm. Then he prepared the potion, quaffed it and, searching for another approach to the conflict, began meditating while hanging from the tree<i>Irminsul</i>by one leg. In this manner he achieved enlightenment, and returned to Spikeroog to live with Ulula in peace and harmony to the end of their days.
   1057893|2469fff2||Modolf, progenitor of Clan Drummond, who was granted mastery over the isle of Undvik, unlike his brothers displayed no extraordinary abilities: he was neither wise nor especially brave, nor did he possess any particular gift which would make him a great individual. He resented Hemdall for not bestowing greater talent upon him. Hemdall, however, insisted he had blessed each of his sons with equal gifts, but not all revealed themselves at once - Modolf would have to wait for the right moment for his gifts to step forward. Yet the hero was impatient and could not wait for this moment. Instead, again and again he sought out trouble of the worst sort, hoping each time his hidden talent would shine. Hemdall grew angry with his son and decided to bury his gift even deeper. Modolf died after a long and unruly life filled with incredible adventures, but a life during which he never discovered his talent. His descendants decided to continue his search elsewhere. They abandoned Undvik and invaded Ard Skellig, eventually taking half of that isle for themselves. They now seek to take the other half, but whether doing so would finally reveal their line's unique gift - no one knows.
   1057791|5488a0b0||As is true of most realms, the predominant religion in the Skellige Isles has its roots in the prehistoric cult of the Great Mother, Mother Nature. On the Continent, such worship has taken as its object and namesake Melitele. In Skellige, her counterpart is Freya.<br>Like Melitele, Freya is represented in three aspects - virgin, mother and old crone. That of mother is most common, and sculptors chose to depict her thus in her greatest sanctuary in the Isles. There she stands, a pregnant woman draped in loose robes, her face partially revealed, her head bent and her hands folded across her breast. A golden necklace hangs around her neck, and on it a large, pure diamond (<i>Brisingamen</i>) shines like a clear summer sky.<br>Freyja Modron, or Freya the Great Mother, is the goddess of fertility, love, beauty and abundance. She is also the patron of oracles, soothsayers and telepaths. Warriors pray to her before setting out on sea raids, and the wives they leave behind pray to her for their husbands’ safe return. Only priestesses serve the goddess – men may worship Freya, but only women may do her work. Freya’s priestesses, like the clerics of other cults, treat mages and sorceresses with great reserve.<br>The center of Freya’s worship is her temple on the isle of Hindarsfjall, in the hallowed grove called Hindar. Worshippers place offerings to the goddess before her statue, on an altar that incorporates a great stone basin surrounded by figurines of cats and falcons - her sacred animals. In addition to this temple, sprinkled throughout the isles are other, smaller places where one can worship the goddess and make offerings to her (...).

   1060505|00000000||The devil Fugas held a position of great prestige and responsibility during the Crones' sabbath - that of goon restricting access to the peak. He in no way resembled Torque, the irritating but harmless "deovel" Geralt and I had encountered many, many years prior.<br><br>In size, Fugas resembled a somewhat overgrown troll, and he likewise displayed a troll's lack of subtlety. There was not a jot of mischievous puck or cunning verbal trickster about this "devil." Instead, he did his job with the commitment and professionalism of a Novigrad bouncer.<br><br>Trying to stop Geralt, though, turned out to be Fugas' dumbest and last idea, ending both his life and his flourishing career in the Crones' employ.
   1060531|00000000||Ciri was able to shed a bit of light on the King of the Wild Hunt's motivations. The threat of annihilation hung over the Aen Elle homeland. Eredin, a warrior and a conqueror by nature, decided to solve this problem in the simplest possible way - by seizing our world. The key to doing so? Ciri's power, which would allow him to open the gates to a full-scale invasion.<br>
   1060532|00000000||According to Avallac'h, it was Eredin who bore responsibility for the death of Auberon Muircetach, the previous ruler of the Aen Elle. Revealing this fact would certainly not earn him friends and popularity amongst the Alder Folk.<br>
   1060539|00000000||The emperor clearly and succinctly laid out what he wanted. His daughter and Geralt's ward, Cirilla, was in great danger, for the Wild Hunt was on her trail. Geralt, a superb tracker linked to Emhyr's daughter by the iron bonds of Destiny, stood a better chance of finding her than anyone else in the world.<br>
   1060538|00000000||Few names in the Continent's history arouse as much terror and respect as that of Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd - the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. Emperor of Nilfgaard, lord of Metinna, Ebbing and Gemmera, sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro, he was ruler of half the civilized world and aspiring conqueror of the other half. He was a personage whose deeds and decisions shaped the fates of whole kingdoms and populations.<br><br>What then could he possibly want of a simple witcher?<br>
   1060525|00000000||The name of the King of the Wild Hunt, the identity of the lord of nightmares, the being behind the frightful mask - this long remained unknown. Over time, however, scraps of information gradually coalesced into a full likeness of our foe - but did nothing to detract from the terror he inspired.<br><br>The Wild Hunt was in truth an elite cavalry brigade from the world of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, and was commanded by their ambitious and ruthless king, Eredin Bréacc Glas. He would travel via secret paths through the cold emptiness between his world from ours to capture victims and take them back to his homeland as slaves.<br><br>The current object of his Hunt was Cirilla, whose power he wanted to harness for his own uses. The only obstacle in his path - Geralt of Rivia.<br>
   1060472|00000000||As predicted, Ge'els acted out of loyalty to his former king and withdrew support for Eredin once he learned the truth about Auberon's death. This momentous act portended important ramifications for the outcome of the coming battle.
   1060181|00000000||Sadly, there was no communicating with Uma. The gnarled twiglet lived in his own miniature world. Yet Geralt knew Uma was the key to finding Ciri. Even if no pertinent information was forthcoming from the creature's stunted lips, surely further investigation would squeeze some solution out of this riddle.<br>
   1059723|00000000||Upon closer acquaintance, Menge only confirmed Geralt's initial impression of his bestiality. Luckily the witcher's blade ended this madman's life and rid the world of one the more hideous monsters ever to walk its surface.<br>
   1059722|00000000||The paranoid executioner never set foot outside his fortified headquarters without a crowd of armed guards to accompany him. Knowing my life was on the line, my friends decided to pursue a risky plan to infiltrate Menge's offices - their only hope for a face-to-face meeting with the man.<br>
   1059720|00000000||In those days rampant persecution and the smoke of a hundred pyres choked Novigrad's air. This grim climate provided cover in which a great many bloody butchers built comfortable nests for themselves. Drummed-up conspiracies, mass arrests and show trials resulting in group executions were the favorite building blocks.<br><br>Caleb Menge, the fanatically ambitious commander of the Church of the Eternal Fire's Temple Guard, was one such opportunist, his moment of triumph coming when he unmasked his superior, the former Temple Guard commander Chappelle, as a doppler in disguise.<br><br>Geralt first saw Menge lighting Chappelle's pyre in Novigrad's main square and had no doubt that, for this man, the appellation "fanatical whoreson" was too mild by far.<br><br>
   1059803|00000000||Those in the know claimed Voorhis' rank and experience made him a shoo-in to succeed the emperor in the event Emhyr decided to hang up his crown.<br>
   1059801|00000000||Morvran Voorhis -  commander of the Alba Division, an officer of the highest rank and a pure-blooded aristocrat, one who with pride could call himself a Nilfgaardian, a designation reserved only for native-born inhabitants of the empire's capital and its immediate surroundings.<br><br>At the time of their first meeting Geralt had no idea what an important person had been assigned the task of "asking him a few routine questions." Knowing the witcher, however, knowledge of Morvran's rank and status would not have made much of a difference.<br>
   1059809|00000000||Imlerith - a general of the Wild Hunt and a frequent guest in Geralt's nightmares - had been chasing Ciri for quite some time, striving to deliver her to his ruler, Eredin.<br><br>This powerful and brutal warrior had fought in the countless battles and campaigns for conquest waged by the Aen Elle in other worlds. He prized physical confrontation above all else, seeking out direct, bloody skirmishes where opponents pit their strength, agility and training against each other in a contest to the death.<br>
   1059679|00000000||The Free City of Novigrad had known no king's rule for nearly two hundred years. Francis Bedlam surely had this fact in mind when he anointed himself the King of Beggars, a title that mocked the pomposity of crowned heads while simultaneously stealing a bit of said pomp for itself. Bedlam was a pragmatic man, a trait of great use in his profession, which involved managing a network of thieves, beggars, tramps and street urchins that trickled through every part of the city.<br><br>His contacts provided him with the freshest gossip and tastiest morsels of information, and the cut he took of his "subjects'" earnings guaranteed a sizeable income for the maintenance of his "court" in the Putrid Grove.<br>
   1059649|00000000||Cleaver was famed for his hot temper. What boiled his blood hottest of all, however, were folk who thought they could pull one over on him.<br><br>No wonder, then, that the attack by Whoreson's thugs riled him somewhat. The violent tirade he directed at Wiley clearly contained not idle threats but promises he meant to keep, even if doing so meant leaving half a district of the city in ruins.<br>
   1059648|00000000||A joke circulates about the back alleys and seedy taverns of Novigrad. It claims the dwarf Carlo Varese, one of the four leading lights of the local criminal strata, was, in his own way, a fierce proponent of racial coexistence. He applied this principle in a somewhat selective fashion, however.<br><br>Cleaver firmly felt that, as an assimilated dwarven resident of the city of Novigrad, he had every right to run his own business. Anyone who had a problem with the way he ran it or with the nature of his dealings - be they dwarf, human or halfling - revealed themselves a vile racist. And what was the only fitting thing to do with such scum? Why, feed them to a herd of ferociously hungry hogs – right after he sliced off their fingers with his namesake cleaver. Naturally, such tales could very well have been mere rumor and slander – but very few had the courage to test their veracity.<br>
   1059655|00000000||When Geralt got a chance to talk to Ciri about Avallac'h, he learned that the Sage had been her tutor and mentor for some time. They were bound by a common enemy. Avallac'h had been the chief advisor to the previous ruler of the Aen Elle, whose demise had precipitated a conflict between Avallac'h and the successor, Eredin. The Sage had thus made it his mission to protect Ciri from his new king's malicious designs, whatever the cost.<br><br>Ciri made it clear to Geralt that she trusted the Sage. He had saved her life on numerous occasions – including when, feeling the onset of the curse that would transform him into Uma, he resolved to hide her form the Wild Hunt on the Isle of Mists.<br>
   1059654|00000000||Geralt and I had long known that Chappelle, Chancellor of Security for the Church of the Eternal Fire in Novigrad, had died years ago and been replaced by a doppler masquerading under his name. We didn't breathe a word of this to anyone, of course, for the change was decidedly in everyone's best interest. The doppler had proved a reasonable creature deprived of the true Chappelle's cruelty, and under his watch life in the city had much improved.<br><br>Sadly, the chancellor's conciliatory style must have raised suspicions as a wave of terror and persecution began to swell over Novigrad. The doppler was found out, arrested and burned at the stake for the greater glory of the Eternal Fire.
   1059652|00000000||The being trapped within Uma's tortured husk turned out to be Avallac'h – a powerful Sage of the Aen Elle elves. Geralt had made his acquaintance years before. Already during these prior encounters Avallac'h had displayed an intense and, frankly, rather unnerving interest in the Elder Blood and its bearer, Ciri. His exact motives were unclear at the time, and he had made no particular effort to explain them to Geralt.<br><br>Geralt likewise had no idea what bound Ciri and the elf now. There was no doubt Avallac'h had helped her, had saved her numerous times from the Wild Hunt – but why? Alas, the Sage, quivering on a razor's edge between life and death, offered no answers to Geralt's burning questions.<br><br>He did, however, muster enough strength to utter a crucial piece of information – Ciri's location.<br>

In foul times, when plague and famine reap their harvest, we must beg the Ladies for help.

Seek out the Ladies' shrine - 'tis where the Trail of Treats begins. Set the child off on the trail and it shall follow the sweet track and find the Good Ladies.

   1059023|00000000||When the children in the swamp clearing first told Geralt about Johnny, the witcher had every reason to suppose no such person actually existed. It was difficult to imagine anyone living in such inhospitable surroundings without quickly becoming food for drowners or water hags.<br><br>Geralt thus suspected Johnny was the figment of childish imaginations, an imaginary friend for lonely orphans. Long years of experience, however, told him not to ignore any possible lead, so he decided to search the nearby swampland for any additional signs of Johnny.<br>
   1059043|00000000||Graham was a simple fisherman from an even simpler village, Oreton, yet the role he had played in local events was anything but. Fyke Isle, the tower, the curse - he had been a key part of it all. Geralt had learned from Anabelle about the deep feelings the two had shared, but the rest of their tragic story only emerged later…<br>
   1058824|00000000||The Whispering Hillock - if the world were not as it is but as it should be, this name would denote a place of hidden nooks and lovers sharing heartfelt lies in hushed voices. Instead, it stood for danger and terror, for a place where wild animals, driven by some mysterious power, had killed many an inhabitant of Downwarren. Geralt agreed to investigate the problem, and soon discovered the animals were controlled by a spirit entrapped in a tree growing atop the hill. The spirit spoke to him in a woman's voice, and claimed to have once been a druidess who had kept watch over the Velen grove until the Crones murdered her and imprisoned her ghost in the tree. The forces of nature she had once served now protected her from the fiendish sisters' further designs. The unfortunate locals had died as collateral damage, for, the spirit attested, nature's wrath is unrestrainable and distinguishes not between unwary innocents and unwelcome ill-wishers.<br><br>The spirit begged Geralt to lift her curse and free her from her torment. In exchange, she promised to rescue the orphans from the swamp clearing, who would otherwise face a cruel death at the hands of the Crones.<br>

   1072893|00000000||Some time later it was revealed that Roche had took part in a conspiracy to assassinate Radovid. He had realized that once the war was over this mad king would offer no prospect of a free Temeria, making Roche himself a liability and potential foe.<br>

For it just keeps growing.</i><br>-Amerigo Veltucci, cartographer<br><br>Until about a quarter century ago, only the well educated had even heard of Nilfgaard. Back then the empire, though already expanding, had not yet cast its shadow over the Northern Realms. Today, when its black-clad legions have carried banners bearing the Great Sun across the Yaruga all the way to the southern banks of the Pontar, no man in the North does not know the empire's name - and does not tremble upon hearing it.<br><br>Nilfgaard is currently ruled by Emhyr var Emreis, a great politician and strategist. The country consists of about a half dozen provinces, formed from once-conquered lands, and numerous satellite states such as Ebbing, Salm, Toussaint, Maecht, Metinna or Cintra. The latter, though formally independent, are in fact governed directly by the emperor.<br><br>For such a diverse and quickly expanding state, Nilfgaard is surprisingly stable. In recent memory, no rebellion, uprising or domestic war has upset the famed <i>Pax Nilfgaardiana</i>. This might derive from the fact that Nilfgaardians cherish order above all else, including wars and conquest - and  respect laws and courts to an extent unparalleled anywhere in the North.

Currencies, in particular, have been greatly affected by the political upheaval.<br><br>The surest coin is the crown minted in Novigrad. Thanks to the free city's vibrant economy, its currency is highly valued and is the only means of payment accepted around the world, by the North's merchants, nobles, townsfolk and simple peasants, as well as by Nilfgaardian quartermasters, dwarven bankers, women plying the world's oldest trade and, last but not least, by witchers.<br><br>The value of the Nilfgaardian floren depends on the state of the empire's economy rather than on the coin's gold content. The initial success of the empire's military campaign greatly boosted the currency's worth, but months later, as the conflict lagged on, it began to take its toll, and the coin's value is now dropping slowly but surely. Still, Nilfgaardian florens can be exchanged for crowns at most banks and shops. <br><br>The Temerian oren, bearing the aquiline profile of the now-deceased King Foltest, is, like Temeria itself, one of the least fortunate victims of the war. The value of the currency of this battered, occupied country holds stable, but at a very low level, reflecting the coin's silver content. Still, my good friend Vimme Vivaldi, Novigrad's foremost banker, advises all to get rid of the Temerian currency at their earliest convenience, just in case.

Said species do indeed exhibit some singular characteristics not observed in their "lesser" cousins, whence the tendency to describe them as "higher" vampires.

[Don't you behave like a Nordling!]</i><br>--Nilfgaardian expression<br><br>"Nordling" is an all-encompassing term for the inhabitants of the Northern Realms, used mostly by Nilfgaardians and, more rarely, by the folk of Skellige. It is most often used as an epithet implying laziness, treachery, barbarity and excessive lust. As much as I would like to contend we do not deserve such a damning reputation, I generally strive not to lie.

The Crones of Crookback Bog are such creatures. No one knows their true names, nor what breed of monstrosity they in fact are. <br><br>Common folk have given these three sisters the names Weavess, Brewess and Whispess, and call the threesome "The Ladies of the Wood" or simply "The Good Ladies." The Crones act as the true sovereigns of Velen, whose inhabitants they help survive through harsh times in return for unquestioning obedience. They wield powerful magic, but one different from that of mages. They draw power from water and earth and are bound to the land in which they live. The Crones can hear everything that happens in their woods, predict the future, twist the threads of human lives and bring blessings as well as curses.<br><br>The Crones seem for all intents and purposes to be immortal. Magic elixirs keep them from aging and allow them to take the appearance of young women. These elixirs and their mystical ties to the swamps in which they live also give them supernatural strength and vitality.

   1077674|00000000||It is a witcher's good fortune that higher vampires are extremely rare – and not all are dangerous to humans. Though they do have a taste for blood, they do not need to drink it to survive. Some higher vampires have renounced feeding on humans altogether and do no harm to anyone, but others give in to their desires. A witcher who braves fighting a higher vampire must bear in mind that he faces a monster endowed with incredible strength, one able to manipulate men and animals, turn invisible and transform into a giant bat - and furthermore one which it is nearly impossible to kill. In other words, even an experienced monster slayer should think twice before accepting a contract on one of these creatures, even if half a kingdom and a princess' hand is in the offing.
   1077697|630b75e9||Dearest Sir Robert de Mere,<br><br>Thank you for sending a bill of exchange in advance, and for your understanding - if I gave out advice for free, I'd very quickly run myself out of business.<br><br>You wrote that your son went missing while on a voyage - and that near the place where he was last seen there now lurks a nekker who wears a tattered shirt with your son's monogram sewed on it. You asked if it is possible that this nekker was your son, transformed by some spell.<br><br>After consulting the relevant literature, it pains me to inform you that your hypothesis is highly improbable, and there exists a much simpler and more likely explanation. Contrary to popular belief, nekkers are a sapient species. Like forest trolls, they will at times decorate themselves with pigment or scraps of human garments. One can with some confidence surmise that this nekker killed your son, tore up his shirt, then donned it or some fragment thereof.<br><br>While that is most likely the case, one cannot be certain. Though I have not heard of any curse capable of turning a man into a nekker, I cannot rule out the possibility of its existence. In order to find out if the above-mentioned nekker truly is a creature born of a curse, the tattered shirt it wears must be taken from it, cut into shreds and burned. The shirt's ashes can then be mixed with dimeritium dust. If the resulting substance changes color, it will confirm your hypothesis.<br><br>If the experiment I described returns a positive result, please write me. I would gladly undertake further examinations meant to find a way to lift this curse - for additional payment, of course.<br><br>Greetings,<br><br>Klaus Kellerman, <i>Magister Artibus Oxoniensis</i>

When humans encroached on their lands, however, griffins soon discovered a new source of much more plentiful and easier-caught prey: cows, sheep and shepherds. Though still wary of main roads and towns (where folk with the means to hire a witcher are like to dwell), these half-eagle, half-wildcat creatures have gone from rarities to oft-encountered pests known throughout the Northern Realms. Especially hated are the subspecies known as royal griffins and archgriffins.<br>
   1077568|6ad3ffa9||Folk say they were four at first. The Mother, She-Who-Knows, the Lady of the Wood, came here from a faraway land and since she suffered terribly from loneliness, she made three daughters out of dirt and water.<br><br>A long, long time ago the Mother was sole ruler of all of Velen. Her daughters brought her the people's requests and served as her voice. Each spring, sacrifices of grain, animals and men were made to the Lady of the Wood on her special night. Yet as the years passed, the Lady of the Wood slipped deeper and deeper into madness. Her madness eventually spread over the land - men took to abandoning their homes and setting out into the bog, where they became food for beasts. Before long, Velen was drowning in blood.<br><br>The daughters saw their land nearing destruction and took it upon themselves to save it. When spring came once more, and with it the night of sacrifices, they killed their mother and buried her in the bog. Her blood watered the oak atop Ard Cerbin, and from then on the tree grew wholesome and hearty fruit for the people. As for the Lady's immortal soul, it refused to leave its beloved land and so the sisters imprisoned it. To this day it lies trapped beneath the Whispering Hillock, where it thrashes about in powerless rage.

   1080719|760a065d||While Nilfgaard's emperor wields absolute power, harshly crushing the slightest sign of disobedience, opposing forces continue to exist within the empire. By this I do not mean the disgruntled leaders of conquered provinces, but the magnates within the City of a Thousand Towers who are unhappy with the current leadership. This conflict between the emperor and the noble houses of Nilfgaard the capital dates back many years. All the princes of the blood and magnates expected their ruler to wed one of their daughters and sire an heir with one of their own. The emperor, however, had other plans. This proved a slap in the face for all the great families from which he refused to take a bride.<br><br>The Nilfgaardian opposition patiently waits for the emperor to slip up, for some event to occur which will weaken his authority, be it an economic crisis or a defeat in battle. A secret conspiracy lies ready to seize such a moment to incite the disaffected, assassinate the emperor and carry out a coup d'état culminating with one of their own number ascending to the throne.<br><br>For obvious reasons, only a limited few know of this conspiracy, but any shrewd observer of Nilfgaardian politics can read the signs of its workings. So long as men are men and the world is as it is, certain dynamics will forever remain the same, and the discontented will always form subversive societies with their secret signs and hidden agendas.

   1087431|9eedd515||The smallest of the Skellige Isles is also the birthplace of the islander's culture. Skelligers believe themselves direct descendants of Otkell, a legendary hero who was the first practitioner of the cult of Freya in the isles. He erected a beautiful temple in honor of the goddess on Hindarsfjall (sadly the temple has been closed to visitors in recent years due to concerns about the possible theft of the famous diamond, Brisingamen, ornamenting the goddess' statue). Otkell also constructed a fantastic garden near the temple - this can still be visited upon making prior arrangements with the priestesses' mother superior.<br><br>An enticing option for those wishing to visit Hindarsfjall is the package excursion offered by the congregation of Freya worshippers in Poviss. Thanks to a longstanding agreement with the isle's priestesses, they can offer tours of all the local highlights at a very reasonable price. This is by far the best option for families with children or the elderly.

   1086979|00000000||Some monsters are so powerful local populaces begin worshiping them as gods. Such was the case with the leshen dwelling in the woods near the Skellige village of Fayrlund. The elders were absolutely convinced the monster watched over them by defending them from their enemies and training their hunters.<br><br>The witcher had his doubts, however. Leshens are mean, self-serving creatures - and the ancient one living in the woods near Fayrlund was surely no exception.<br><br>Geralt knew freeing the villagers from their supposed protector's grasp would be no easy task - if he decided to even try. The leshen known as the Woodland Spirit was so powerful as to have mastered the art of marking. This meant the monster had inserted his essence into one of the residents of Fayrlund. As long as this unfortunate soul remained alive and near the settlement, the leshen would always be reborn near its lair.<br><br>Yet even with the marked one eliminated, killing the leshen would be no easy task. The monster commanded the obedience of the denizens of the woods - it could thus call on wolves, ravens or even the trees themselves for help. Luckily, it had a weakness as well: it was vulnerable to fire, that born of the Igni Sign in particular.

   1087087|00000000||The residents of White Orchard had suffered more than their fair share of misfortunes. Passing armies had trampled their spring planting, a griffin had begun abducting their livestock, and, the rotten icing on this painful cake, a noonwraith haunted a nearby well. No wonder the locals called this final evil a 'devil'. The witcher could sense something bound her to this place, and that in order to send her off into the ethereal realms he would first need to learn her secret.<br><br>Once that was done, he would have to prepare for battle - and a noonwraith is a demanding opponent. She can disorient her victim by blinding him and creating mirror images of herself. These copies slowly suck their victim's life energy - while their mistress remains untouchable. In order to defeat her, the witcher could not rely on his silver sword alone - the Yrden sign would also be needed to trap her and force her to take on material form.

The brother had left home to take up arms against Nilfgaard. The forces of the North and the Black Ones had then clashed in a great battle near the brothers' home village, and the peasant had not heard from his sibling since.
   1086613|00000000||While scouring Skellige for reasons more important, Geralt happened to find a horn. Any other man might have shrugged and scoffed - not so the witcher, and not because he occasionally enjoyed a toot. Inside the chest containing the horn, Geralt also found a journal. The witcher read it, hoping to learn something about the individual to whom the horn had belonged.
   1086543|00000000||Geralt's first attempts to talk to her came to nothing. He was only able to break through her mistrust with the help of a godling named Johnny. A few words from the latter convinced Gran to help Geralt talk to the mysterious Ladies of the Wood.<br>

According to legend, djinns can grant even the most far-fetched wishes, though they do so begrudgingly.<br><br>Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings. A mage who succeeds in doing so can then draw energy from such a spirit, using it to cast spells without having to summon the Power from traditional sources.

To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will, one must first weaken it - and that is no easy task.<br><br>Fighting djinns is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could never master with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating the element of air they can summon gales, powerful storms, even hurricanes. Luckily, as magic beings they are vulnerable to silver - yet steel will do them no harm.

   1081909|00000000||The apparition haunting the fields outside Novigrad turned out to be a noonwraith. Some powerful emotion must have bound it to that place - love, hate, anger or perhaps all three at once. Like every wraith of this type, she was surely capable of forming mirror images of herself, which served to mislead opponents and restore her vitality. Luckily, these mirages could be dispelled with a quick slash from a silver blade. Like any noonwraith, she would undoubtedly seek to assume immaterial form while fighting, making her almost impossible to injure - unless she is first caught in a trap laid by the Yrden Sign, or blasted with a special bomb. Once thus forced into materiality, she should be attacked with strong blows or the Igni Sign. Finally, one must always keep in mind two witcher sayings: "The longer you fight a noonwraith, the lower your chances of surviving," and "Fight a noonwraith at midday and you'll be dead before dusk."

I know we all hear it - Madame Bouquet admitted it keeps her awake all night long, and she lives further away from the cemetery than any of us.<br><br>If there is any witcher who can put an end to all the screaming, brawling and insults, I'll pay him from my own pouch.<br><br>Ask them to point out Charles Lanzano at the Clever Clogs.

   1113901|c799bcb6||Brethren!<br><br>I write you now in my own blood, so you may now what fate befell me.<br><br>Following M’s orders, I traveled to Novigrad to resupply and sell our latest batch of fisstech. I left the men in my command on our boat along with the goods and the coin while I went to the hut on the beach to await WJ’s men. When they arrived, it was well after dark, and one of them bore a linen sack on his back. This sack did not contain the promised Novigrad crowns – instead, it held the heads of my men. The scoundrels demanded to know where the fisstech was, but I only told them about the case on the ship, which they will never open without the key. My choice to slip this into my arse shortly before they caught me proved wise, for they searched everywhere else. Though they interrogated me harshly, I withheld the truth. Instead I insisted one of the men they murdered on the ship was carrying the key, and my role was merely to negotiate. They wanted to kill me at once, but their captain had another idea at the last minute. They locked me in this becursed cage, to wither and die slowly from hunger and thirst.<br><br>The second day of my captivity I heard the screams of my captors. I know not whether I saw true or visions, but it seemed drowners had emerged from the water and were devouring the whoresons alive. Yet the problem remains that they (the whoresons, not the drowners) have so securely locked me in I see no means of escape…<br><br>I have sat here six days now. I stopped feeling hunger after the third, my guts having turned in on themselves. Now I dream only of drink. I’d give all the gold in the world for a sip of water. It could be rank and full of larvae, and still I would guzzle it greedily… I drank my own urine for the first few days, but I no longer produce any.<br><br>I have nothing left. Not even hope. The last thing keeping me sane is the task of writing this letter to you. Farewell.<br>Anselm

I feel damned bad it was you they fingered back then – fate's a bitch atimes, ain't she? But you're a made man now: I hid your part of the loot in that cave they wouldn’t let us play in when we were young. Was full of them massive spiders then, but not a sign of the critters now. Hunters claim they’ve migrated elsewhere, not enough to eat here, so they won’t be coming back any time soon. So it’s safe, but the bad memories do a great job keeping out nosy hayseeds – making it the ideal hiding spot for loot.<br><br>The chest is buried in the second part of the cave. Get it and you'll be a rich man and can drink and wench till the end of your days. See you later, you know where, we’ll bathe in wine and live in luxury.<br><br>A.D.

   1109257|6259f0ec||My study of Elgar's armor has allowed me to devise new alloys and increase the magic conductivity of the second crystal. This might be the breakthrough I needed in my work on the teleport. For my trial run, I have calibrated the portal to exit in the cave near the tower's base. I need now only charge the crystal with solar energy, for which purpose I have placed it in the outer wall of the tower, near the scaffolding. Only hours remain before it is entirely charged!<br><br>I have finished my work on a diagram which will allow us to replicate this armor and equip the entire School of the Wolf with it. Varin, the witchers' fencing instructor, has taken credit for this find, but it was I who, using logical deduction and only a slight dollop of magic assistance, uncovered the chamber where Elgar must have once resided. The space was hidden behind a primitive illusion, one needed merely look carefully to see through it. I found notes which indicate Elgar had worked out diagrams for improvements to his equipment which he then hid for safekeeping in various locations around the world. Careful study of his notes allowed me to write up instructions on how to find these upgrades. I went to the old watchtower and gave this research to Chird. As soon as he finishes preparing the silver sword diagram, he will set out to gather all the upgrade diagrams. Varin has the finished steel sword diagram and will begin forging blades based on it. I hope he will distribute them to the poor lads he trains - they at least deserve proper equipment after going through the horror he calls training.<br><br>By the gods - I think I see fire on the horizon, coming from where the old watchtower stands! I can also hear some kind of commotion outside my tower.<br><br>The way down is blocked - what is going on?!

   1108371|e5632e7b||I write in great haste, for each moment might bring my demise. A band of peasants wielding all manner of sharp or heavy farmyard implements has stormed the keep. I was in the workshop when they attacked, working on a new silver sword diagram, and did not notice the mob's approach. I have barricaded the doors but know this cannot last forever. I can only hope Varin will come and rescue me before they break through.<br><br>Luckily we completed work on a new steel sword diagram a few days ago and gave it to Varin to forge. Armed with this fine weapon and aided by his witcher pupils, I'm sure he'll easily handle a bunch of peasants swinging hoes and rakes. Yet even rakes can do great harm to an unarmed scholar such as my master. Hieronymus has been shut up in his tower for days, absorbed in his work on a new armor diagram. He might remain oblivious still to the danger he is in. Should the mob find him before Varin can slice them down... <br><br>And to think I nearly escaped this nightmare! If I had only listened to my master... Hieronymus had drawn up some notes for me on locations connected with the legendary Elgar, a witcher of the School of the Wolf. It is said Elgar had devised some improvements to the School's gear, and I was to follow his trail in search of these diagrams. Had I left even as late as yesterday, I would have been a safe distance from Kaer Morhen by the time the mob attacked. Instead, I tarried, and now I cower, fearing for my life...
   1108370|6c1f0631||Journal kept by Chird, the mage Hieronymus' assistant
   1108368|c23f81d8||Cannot move. Spine broken, liver (perhaps spleen?) pierced. Knew jumping into portal was extremely risky with only 1 crystal powering it - but still better than certain death at hands of enraged peasants. Mob broke into tower, cut off path to second crystal. Had to flee. Grabbed diagrams for Wolf School gear before going - hoping Varin would come save them, if not me. Perhaps he will come still, will jump through the portal, retrieve his diagrams, rescue me... A foolish hope. My time is very short.
   1108358|9e0d83d3||For safekeeping, Elgar hid his improvements to the School of the Wolf's equipment in multiple locations. One set he hid in an underwater cave beneath a castle in central Velen. Another he left in a cave to the south of Oxenfurt, while a third he placed in the elven ruins found on a small isle in southern Velen.
   1108363|f7ebecc2||Elgar hid improvements for School of the Wolf gear in various corners of the world, so that witchers could make use of them on the Path. Some he hid in elven ruins and a sunken ship in the south of Velen.. Others he put in a hideout far to the south of Oxenfurt.
   1108362|d4a897b3||Elgar placed upgrades to School of the Wolf witcher gear in three different caves in the area immediately to the south of Kaer Morhen. He hoped future generations of witchers would find them in an hour of need.
   1108361|f6371423||Elgar hid further improvements to the equipment used by the School of the Wolf in various regions of the Skellige Isles. He put some in a wooden fort in southern Ard Skellig. Another set he hid in the ruins in the western portion of Hindarsfjall. A third stash was hidden in the burial mounds found in western Ard Skellig.
   1108360|9fc25c72||It seems Elgar hid some upgrades to his gear in the area around Kaer Morhen. Some he hid in the deepest cave he could find, the one in the northern portion of the Kaer Morhen valley. Others he hid in the  abandoned, crumbling watchtower in the same area. Still others he placed amidst the rocks on the shore of the valley's lake.
   1108367|6c494cb4||Notes written in a shaky hand
   1108364|098ed2f4||Some of the improvements to School of the Wolf gear are hidden in the Skellige Isles. Elgar left them in the central part of Ard Skellig and in the ruins of two watchtowers: one on Undvik, one on Spikeroog. He wanted them to be available for witchers who need them and are clever enough to find them.

Worth considering. <br><br>Agent Shinetop is still out on his mission. No word from him for several days. Waiting for further instructions.

My sympathies to your wife.<br><br>Only thing else I can think of is powdered boar tusk, but I’ve not got any in stock – boars have been hunted mighty thin around here. I have heard about one wandering the woods near my hut, but they say it’s a monstrous beast that's done in a few hunters already, so I'd recommend staying clear of it.<br><br>In the end, though, you do as you think you must.<br><br>– Otto Bamber

I'm willing to trade a lovely tin pot, painted with cornflowers and lilies (and showing a few holes, true, but that's a plus, for you can add a few more and look at that, you've got a colander) for a cart. The cart needn't be big, can even be tiny, in fact, just so that two, or better four, people could fit in it, with ample room for bags and sacks, if possible. Could be old, long as it rides well and has new wheels, and strong axles, so actually probably nothing made longer than a year or two ago would do.<br><br>Leave a message with Bohddie.

I know, only a real blackguard enjoys another’s funeral, but that wench was as grouchy a miser as they come. No one liked her, not even a little. So why’m I writing about her? Because I happen know the old wench left behind a sizeable stash of gold, her being so damn stingy all her rotten life and not having any weans to leave anything to. So I’m going to her cellar this evening to look around, see what I can find. You take your lass (my sister, treat her right, you bastard) and head to Stacheier soon as you can.

   1126469|f2e3df17||Kulik Kulikov and his men are busy preparing the hunt, so I’ve a few moments to write up this whole incredible affair.<br><br>Week back I arrived home in Oxenfurt after a long journey and found I’d received a letter from my barrister. My aunt Helena had finally passed on and left all her belongings, including her hut outside Novigrad, to me. The letter included a copy of her will and a key to the chest in which she had stashed her savings. Remembering how my dear auntie would serve her guests only bread and water, I was sure she’d managed to save up a hefty stash of coin during her long and miserly life. So I raced off in a flash to my aunt’s hut, to pay my respects at her grave, and while there, take a gander at what’s in that chest. But when I got there, the hut was in ruins and the neighboring peasants were claiming a griffin had nested on my aunt’s lands. So there I was, a fortune in arm’s reach, and not a way to get at it. So I went back to Oxenfurt and raced to the Alchemy, fast as my feet would take me, for I’d heard the famous Kulik Kulikov and his crew were watering their horses there after their latest adventure. We agreed terms quick enough (he’d get a portion of what we found in the chest) and set off to exterminate this ploughing pest of a griffin.<br><br>Now I’m sitting and watching Kulikov’s lads arm the ballista, writing this all down to calm my nerves and pass the time.<br><br>Fun’s about to start!

   1122954|f1632238||There once was a young woman named Marlene and a young man named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was so handsome no maid could tear her eyes off him. Every maid in the village, from the fairest to the plainest, yearned to win his favor.<br><br>Marlene, too, was struck by his beauty and soon fell in love with him, as a love as deep as only a first love can be. This feeling was so overwhelming, Marlene realized she could never live without Bartholomew. Yet it was her misfortune that by then Bartholomew already had a wife and a young son.<br><br>Marlene refused to give in to this misfortune, however, and worked long and hard to convince Bartholomew that she was his one true love. In the end she succeeded, for women possess the gift of persuasion and many a man has succumbed to their entreaties.<br><br>Bartholomew’s wife refused to accept his change of heart. But Marlene found a way to deal with that as well.<br><br>Marlene convinced Bartholomew he must get rid of his wife once and for all, and so he chopped off her head. Everything would have ended well, with the young lovers living happily ever after, had not the crime been witnessed by Bartholomew’s five-year-old son. Marlene saw no other solution than to convince Bartholomew, by now her rightful husband, to dispose of the child like his mother and bury his body next to hers, so that they might be together for all eternity.<br><br>Yet this time Bartholomew put his foot down and refused to do what Marlene asked of him. “It is one thing to kill my wife, but to kill my child, the fruit of my loins?” he said. He only changed his mind when the lad began to speak, loudly and frequently, about what he had seen. And though Bartholomew could never raise his hand against his firstborn son, he found another way to deal with the problem. While the boy slept, he snuck into his room, lifted him up and set him in a coffin, which he then buried under the apple tree in their yard.<br><br>After that day, strange things began occurring in the area where the couple lived. The trees lost their leaves and stopped bearing fruit. Folk dwelling nearby were hounded by evil dreams. One by one they fled their homes and farmsteads, until only Marlene and Bartholomew were left.<br><br>One day Marlene dreamt the boy had awoken in his casket under the apple tree and begun to cry. She yearned to have a child of her own and such dreams troubled her greatly. She thus took a spade and dug up the coffin. Inside she found the child’s body, but its arms or legs were missing. She thought the poor lad must have gnawed them off from wild hunger before he died. The sight of the child’s mangled torso so terrified Marlene she reburied the coffin at once and never said a word about it to her husband.<br><br>They lived together a great many years afterwards, but theirs was not a good life. Bartholomew had changed. He slowly stopped cherishing Marlene, and then stopped speaking. He hanged himself on the night of the summer solstice, leaving his wife alone with her dreams. Before she died, Marlene dug up the child’s coffin one more time. No one knows where she went and what she did with it. Their lands have lain deserted ever since. No plants will grow there, and no birds sing.<br><br>Wilhelm & Jacob G.

Only a portion of the notes have survived.]<br><br>Day 134<br>I came across the remains of a destroyed golem in the swamps outside Vizima… Words cannot describe the rage that overcame me. The brickmakers who  keep a settlement nearby told me this act of vandalism was perpetrated by some white-haired witcher. I had heard the members of that guild were vile whoresons, but to stoop to that!<br><br>Day 163<br>The idea struck me that I might find something of use in the Oxenfurt Academy archive. I managed, with great difficulty, to cross the Pontar, but once in Oxenfurt I met with an unpleasant surprise – the Academy has been closed! Luckily I was able to gain entry thanks to the help of a professor acquaintance of mine (thank you, Slavoy!). I thus was able to dig out a few dust-covered beauties and… eureka! Near the village of Heddel there’s a tower which (purportedly) once served as a workshop to none other than Master Alzur himself!<br><br>Day 164<br>I made it to the tower. It’s inhabited. A rather eccentric gentleman has made it a roost for his flock of... harpies. I saw him feed their chicks pork! Inconceivable! But let’s return to our core concern. The tower which this loon has turned into a harpy nest truly might have once been Alzur’s workshop. That means this might be the very place where he conducted his research into golems… <br><br>Day 165<br>It’s here! Standing motionless in a stone circle! The local peasants think it’s merely a strangely-formed boulder, but then again, how could such bumpkins ever guess they pass a masterpiece of magic construction on the way to feed their chickens! I’ve already fastened a lightning conductor. It's a shame there are no druids nearby. If I hadn’t slept through my course on meteorological magic, I’d summon a storm myself, but as it is, I can but wait, patiently or otherwise…<br><br>Day 171<br>Been sitting on these cold stones waiting for a change in the weather so long my bowels have almost frozen, but it’s finally here! I must stop writing now for drops are falling on my notebook and smearing my notes. The first rumblings of thunder sound in the distance! I cannot contain my excitement. Soon, the golem shall live again!
   1122978|a581fc93||Day 1<br>Two skint arsewipes from the nearby village drove a cow by. We’d not mind a bit of beef, but these hayseeds were too pathetic to rob: poor as dirt and stinking of the sty. So we let them go. Seed cart doing the Brunwich – Oxenfurt route: not worth it.<br><br>Day 2<br>Dull, dull, dull. Road’s empty.<br><br>Day 3<br>Caught sight of a military transport in the distance. Heavily guarded. Carrying barrels in their wagons. Wine, most like, or herring. Weapons, now that would’ve been worth a try.<br>Lads got bored silly by evening, so they went cavorting with two wenches come to hunt mushrooms in the woods. After they’d had their fun, I forced them to let the lasses go. Here’s hoping they come back quick with some menfolk from their village, give us some entertainment.

I love this job more than any other, for there’s not much to do. Just sit all day waiting for buyers, and naturally when a man’s bored and has good merchandise right under his nose (ha ha ha), he’ll give it a sniff or two. Besides, sometimes someone shows who doesn’t like our profession, or who tries to cheat us. Then we get to give that gentle someone the treatment he deserves.<br><br>Ugh, all this writing’s worn me out. So I think I’ll see if I can sniff up (ha ha ha) a bit of R&R, then I’ll write a poem.<br><br>[margin note]<br>Watch it dance – the world’s heaving turning,<br>Instants pass and answer all life’s yearning.<br>Count it up – the sand flying through the glass.<br>Slurp life down, let its pickle end your fast.<br>Chemicals course and satisfaction slowly fades…<br>Flesh enlists in ecstasy as bliss ploughs your veins,<br>And doom spreads its wares on your life’s cracked remains!

   1123028|643014d6||15th of Blathe<br>Our supply of formic acid grows thinner by the day. True, Master Urlich sent brethren to watch the high road, but I find it far-fetched to believe a caravan of alchemists will ride past them hauling full barrels of acid any time soon. Ergo, we must try to procure some on our own, for otherwise there can be no talk of producing any more fisstech.<br><br>23rd of Blathe<br>My experiments have proven we can obtain the missing substance following a very simple procedure. I now need only convince the brethren of the necessity of a few little bee stings…<br><br>25th of Blathe<br>Obtaining formic acid from bee venom has proven extremely exhausting and is progressing far too slowly to satisfy our needs. Perhaps a change of methods is in order… [scribbled in the margin] idea: simmer common <i>urtica dioica</i> in a covered pot above an open fire, letting the steam condense into a series of wooden buckets underneath, one of which will receive the acidic portion and thus the formic acid…<br><br>26th of Blathe<br>The brethren have grown extremely irritated. Not only by the bee stings, but by the fact that now they must gather stinging nettle…
   1123011|1c6a6751||Ernst, stay away from Deadwight Wood. Forest’s full of overgrown wolves and the ground emits some kind of rancid gas. Plus a week or so back I sent a detachment of men there. Told them they were to do bit of reconnaissance, but that was all hogwash. We’d finished scouting that place out long ago and know the Wood's a deadly trap. That’s why I gathered up the worst of my lot, the ones who don’t do a lick of good to make up for the cost of feeding them, and sent them to a certain death. I know, I hear you asking: is it a dolt’s fault he’s a dolt? Well, these cretins could prove a serious threat to us in battle. During the last skirmish with Radovid’s reapers, two of those idiots failed to recognize our emblems on our shields in the heat of battle and attacked our own men. Which makes me wonder if those numbskulls ever even made it to that wood…<br><br>M.

   1123009|1ab58eb2||That makes three days we’ve been stationed here in Deadwight Wood. 'Tis a gravely important mission. That’s what the commander told us. "We only send the best of the best to Deadwight Wood” – those were his words. I’m damned proud. Strange enough, there ain’t many trees around and not a corpse to be seen. Maybe the Master’s information was out of date and the peasants have felled the whole wood. Thomas says it’s because we went the wrong way, but he can’t read nor write, so I’m not about to trust him. I’m going out to scout around a bit myself after dinner today. I want to draw up a map of these lands, ‘cause the commander didn’t give us one.

The company sued for a deferment of the sale due to some claimed financial difficulties (rumors around town claim the firm’s senior partner was robbed in broad daylight by some white-haired (sic!) witcher), but for obvious reasons I did not agree to prolong the payment period.

Introduced himself politely enough, calling himself Krister, saying he was a tinker from Oxenfurt, come to escape the hue and cry of the big city, but something about him stinks of lies to my nose. He don’t look like the peace-searching kind, more like the peace-disturbing sort. Trouble, I’m telling you!<br><br>No doubt knocked up some maid in town or, even worse, did one in – looks like a killer to me. He’s as much a tinker as I’m an Ofieri enchanter.

   1122936|7406f1b2||I’ve naught left. Not a blooming thing. All I can do now's pass on my family's tale of horror and woe, then pass on myself, soon as I’ve written it all up in this letter.<br><br>Seems a faded dream now, but there were a time when we were happy. My beautiful wife, Ornesta, and myself.  We were married in high style, with a fitting feast, then a year later our dear Mildburga was born. Folk praised the wean’s beauty, said she were the spitting image of her mum. Ornesta’d get all cross when they talked like that, but I paid it no heed at the time. Soon enough our family grew. First Matilda, then Ethel came into the world, both fair as angels. But Ornesta… well, I’ll never forget the eve she sat there, combing her long, chestnut hair while the girls cried and cried. I said to her, “Love, I reckon the lasses’re hungry.” That’s when she lashed out at me for the first time. Said they'd no right to be hungry – they’d stolen her beauty and her youth, that should be more than enough to feed on…<br><br>I should’ve known it then. I should’ve guessed madness had burrowed into my love’s head, and every compliment paid to her lasses' beauty made it burrow ever deeper. Year by year, the young'un's grew taller and more lovely. But time’s not so kind to the old, and Ornesta weren't spared its cruelty, which took her skin’s spring and its sheen of youth.<br><br>One night I was awoken by a startling moon which lit all the world in an eerie glow. I looked around the hut, and saw it was empty. I ran out the door and followed a set of bare footprints, leading to the cemetery by the chapel. Seeing that, my heart jumped up into my throat…<br><br>I found them, all three, lying around the fountain. Were I not been their father, I’d never have recognized them. Deep gashes mutilated their fair faces. Strips of skin and hunks of flesh were strewn all about… As I stood beholding this butchery, I had the feeling someone was watching me. And I weren't mistaken. Ornesta stood there on a stool by a lone tree. She had a rope draped ‘round her neck like some demonic necklace. “They took it from me, all of it, all I had, all I cherished,” she said. Then she jumped.<br><br>She’s dead. My Ornesta. My three daughters – dead as well. I’ll soon join them. I’ve taken all I have and gave it to the gods, perhaps they’ll forgive me and my beloved Ornesta…
   1122942|08eba473||[Fragment of Nicolas Vogel’s laboratory notebook]<br><br>I’ve acquired the eggs. They cost a fortune and left me with barely enough funds to pay the rent for my laboratory, but now I can begin my work in earnest. I’ll soon show those pea-brained admirals of ours that airborne armies are the future of warfare! And the first such army shall be my creation, and shall proudly bear the name of the Redanian Air Force!<br><br>They’ve hatched. Never seen harpies so tiny and – dare I say? – cute. They have no bosoms yet, but do have enormous heads and equally enormous appetites. Bird-like, through and through.<br><br>My first attempts at taming them have brought promising results. The young harpies eat out of our hands, and sometimes eat our hands as well – my assistant’s already lost 2 fingers.<br><br>The ealdorman of Heddel came skittering into our tower, desperately bawling about spiders plaguing in his village, begging for our help, weeping for their picked-upon livestock and offspring, who suffer the most from the arachnoids' bites. Hmph. One swarm of mindless eating machines preying on another. How dare he interrupt my work on the <i>Wunderwaffe</i> for such banalities?! Instead of the arachnocide he requested, I gave him a bottle of arachnomorph pheromones. Won’t he be in for a surprise. But do the peasants not say “spiders and snakes a happy home make”? I’m sure I've heard them say something of the sort.<br><br>Our funds are nearly exhausted. I shall be forced to take something from the rainy day stash I hid from Hubert in the top floor of the tower. The bulk of our outflow goes towards the purchase of pork, which the harpies devour in gargantuan quantities. Perhaps if we were to dress one up in Redanian armor now and present it at court, the king himself would become our patron?<br><br>No, no, no! The entire squadron must be present, else Radovid will deem the whole undertaking a farce!<br><br>It seems our harpies have grown tired of pork. I found the scraps of Hubert’s overalls in one of their cages. No great loss. Hubert had already lost 8 fingers feeding them. Couldn't even grip a broom.<br><br>Catastrophe has struck! Someone opened all the cages and let out the harpies! I’m sure I’ll find them wheezing their last in the grass outside the tower – after all, no one has fed them for a week…

Introduced himself as a biologist. Fellow made a bad impression on me from the start. Short, thin, with a hunched back. Spectacles thick as wine bottles perched on his nose. Had to grin and bear it, though, for he was willing to pay generously (and in species) to rent the tower, first three months delivered in advance. The owner agreed, so what could I do? But I was curious about this "biologist" and wanted to learn what he wanted a whole tower for. He was cagey at first, then let slip, giddy with excitement, that he planned to rear harpies. “You don't rear harpies!” I cried, but he retorted that he'd soon change that and his tamed, tower-bred harpies would prove their use in warfare. Sure, I can see it already: winged vermin donning the Redanian red, flying off all in a row… I swear, if I've ever heard a bigger load of rubbish, my name ain't Rohn Drump!<br><br>[A few pages have been ripped out and… pecked?]<br><br>Vogel's late with the rent.

The learned gent's here, though. Thing is, he's dead. Something vicious sliced open his gut and dragged his innards all over the room… and that's not the worst part – in the workshop's backroom, there's an open cellar filled with half-eaten human corpses! The stank of death's unbearably strong, fills the whole tower. Don't give a rat’s arse anymore about the rent he owes. I’m getting the blazes out of here before something gets me, too…

Said lady came to me with a request: she wanted to learn what price would be certain items would sell for at an upcoming auction.<br><br>After voicing my many objections, I nevertheless relented to the lady’s request - but before you take offense at this interference in your business, please read to the end, for the cards I laid out for this lady told me something very important.<br><br>The constellation of the cards clearly indicated a wolf shall appear at your doorstep and you shall not let him enter, but he shall nevertheless find a way inside. He shall enter your house, then take your house from you. I saw a tower struck by lightning and blood drinking blood. I believe you are extremely aware what that signifies, am I not right?<br><br>As fair reward for this warning, please hand a sum of two thousand crowns to the man delivering this message. <br><br>My sincerest respects,<br>Master Matthew

   1136375|121eb222||Of all the beings inhabiting the Outer Spheres, the spirits of the elementals are the most foreign to human nature. They possess a will of their own and are intelligent, though not in the way of men. For there is no way to fathom their drives and intentions.<br><br>Genies, the most powerful of the elemental spirits, prove the most difficult for men to commune with. Only the true masters of magic have perfected this art, which demands long years of study and risky experiments. Yet even the most adept at the magic arts cannot tame a genie, merely force it to perform certain acts against its own volition.<br><br>They say the mage Stammelford once commanded a d’ao to move a mountain blocking the view from his tower, but even he could never convince a genie to be a willing helpmate in his work or to give sound advice, for the reasoning of these creatures is beyond human understanding.
   1136372|803d95e1||Whosever summons a Visitant into our Realm risks much. Whether flickering as a Spirit in the ether or inhabiting the Flesh of a designated Host, the Visitant shall strive to attain its Liberty, and if it does, it shall wreak great havoc. Thus a Visitant must be summoned only within a protective Circle, which shall bind it as no fetters could.<br><br>The Circle must be complete and eternal, with no ruptures. Its line must be drawn with a steady hand firmly gripping the chalk. Since a stray step, made through carelessness or the Visitant’s trickery, can smudge the line, the Circle must be further secured by a barrier in the form of lit candles made of beeswax. A Circle thus protected shall stand as a sure and inescapable Prison for the Visitant.

   1135709|6a7c522a||It is hard to say anything about Zuetzer Castle without mentioning the tragic death of Anastasia von Bourmann. Once one of the most powerful magnates in Redania, Count von Bourmann retreated from public life after the loss of his only child and never left his family manor to the very end of his days. Currently Zuetzer Castle is but a decaying ruin haunted by a sad past.
   1135735|a300039e||The history of the von Everec estate is as tangled as that of the family itself. The once wealthy Redanian family's manor and lands were auctioned off after they fell deeply in debt, but were returned to von Everec hands by Olgierd, the infamous leader of an informal band of armed men calling themselves the Redanian Free Company. Despite the effort he went through to regain it, Olgierd abandoned the residence some time later, and dark legends concerning it now circulate among its neighbors.
   1135722|6f1db9a4||The essence of Evil is to cause suffering. There exist many varieties of suffering: from common corporeal pain through the rarefied torment of the psyche to deep wounds dealt to the soul. Whence then does Evil arise? Does it appear on its own? Or does it only spread when conditions are ripe? And finally, the most important question: How can Evil be defeated?<br><br>Most believe Evil has always existed, for none remember a time when it did not. Yet is that sufficient proof? I dare to doubt it, for I am a scholar, and the essence of scholarship is to question all hypotheses until they have been rigorously proven.<br><br>The appearance of Evil is closely tied to the existence of Good, its opposite and antithesis. Good without evil is dimensionless and therefore imperceptible. Evil, then, is an integral part of our lives.<br><br>Evil wears many faces and appears in many different forms. One of them wears a skin of flesh. This Evil incarnated as man travels the world, sowing death and suffering. Such Evil is devious and difficult to discern. We usually only note its presence when it is already too late.<br><br>In my scholarly wanderings through the myths and legends of a great many cultures, I’ve come across descriptions of a certain individual which all display a striking similarity. I do not mean in terms of this individual’s outer appearance or name, but of his modus operandi. This Evil works through trickery, tempting at first with the offer of something seemingly good. The price one must pay for this object of temptation, however, is enormous and nonrefundable, and the promised good often contains horrifying hooks and treacherous traps. Beware, then, of any who promise the impossible, for such can only be delivered through the machinations of Evil.

   1135720|8de33a5b||My Notes and Observations<br>Professor Shakeslock<br>The circle O’Dimm created terrifies me. I cannot see it, but I know it is here. I know no name for the sense with which I perceive it. When I near its bounds, strange shivers shoot down my spine. This is not pain, but something that stands my hair on edge like a hedgehog’s quivers.<br><br>A month has passed, and still I stay within the runic circle. Nightmares prey on me more and more. I’ve come to fear sleep. I know not how long I can withstand this.<br><br>I dreamt I had a daughter. This was strange, for I’ve never had children, yet one came to me in my sleep. She was no older than ten. She called me “daddy” and loved me deeply. I could see it in her eyes. The strangest part of all was that I also burned for her with a great paternal love. Can one possibly dream of someone who does not exist? Can one love such a one?<br><br>I no longer fear sleep. Perhaps O’Dimm has decided to give me peace. I have no desire to change his mind.<br><br>My dreams of Amelie give me great joy. My daughter is a good and clever girl. I believe she will grow into a wonderful woman. A shame she exists only in my dreams. Not only do I no longer fear sleep, but now I cannot wait for the moment in which it comes. What a fantastic transformation! If nothing changes, I shall soon try to leave the circle.<br><br>I know now why I dreamt for weeks of the child I never had. It was his doing. This night my daughter died. She caught a strange illness which pocked her whole body with hideous, oozing sores. She cried, begging me to help. I could do nothing. She died in my arms. I awoke soaked with sweat. I remain a wreck, my mind tattered.<br><br>Three months have passed since Amelie’s death. My heart still bleeds, and horrifying visions plague my every moment. I’m a blind man who wishes he saw nothing, for utter blindness would be a relief compared to these tormenting visions.<br><br>I cannot persevere much longer. I have become a deeply unhappy old man.<br><br>I have now lived within the magic circle for a year. Thoughts of suicide haunt my mind ever more often. It would be so simple – I need but step outside the runes…

   1135344|e16336ba||Be ye warned there’s a rascal wandering about. Claims he’s a war hero who lost a kidney and begs for alms. No more than two days past I sheltered him in my home in good faith. Next day I found he’d eaten my larder bare, and had sniffed out where I keep the wine and drank every last drop. Had half a barrel left, no clue how he fit it all in his scrawny belly. Plus my daughter claims he fondled her during the night, and with both hands, too. This lying scoundrel said his name was Odrin, but who the devils knows what he’s truly called.

   1135348|e4cce7f8||Fair folk!<br><br>By order of the honorable Sir Siegfried de Löwe, a levy's to be raised from all the villages in this region. Each household is to give one-fifth of all their goods and chattel. In exchange, our Order will protect them from the vagrants which never fail to prowl the land in times of war. Accept this levy with understanding, and there won't be any unfortunate incidents.<br><br>[someone has vandalized the parchment with a vulgar drawing and several offensive remarks about the knights of the Order and their mothers]
   1135352|0c0c5e41||If you plan on traversing Deadwight Wood, the one near the ruins of Arnskrone Castle – forget about it. Best add on half a league and go around. It's for your own good, for nor you nor no man else'll meet anything good in that place.

   1135330|ddf9857c||Beware! Monstrous spiders've woven foul webs 'round the village of Heddel. Big as a barn the beasts are, and ravenous - but not for flies, as is befitting their kind, but for flesh. If any wandering monster slayer reads this notice, please stop by. You'll surely be rewarded for your trouble if you can clear Heddel of this scourge.

   1135050|1b2c87ba||As ordered, we have occupied the ruins of Zuetzer Castle (local peasants call it Sootser, easier for their tongues). We've pitched a quick camp. Food supplies are running low, but shouldn’t be hard to find provisions here. I've sent three units in search of victuals: two groups, six knights each, watch the highroads, three have taken to hunting in the Buckholt Hills. Following Master Urlich's advice, I've sent Peter of Nayhaer’s unit to Deadwight Wood. That lot shouldn’t cause us any more trouble.

Five of the last seven kidnappings ended in success. Only two of the lads had fathers too miserly to ransom their sons.

   1139591|58f7d13f||The elves are fond of saying, "We do not fear the well-known." Thus wild boars, being similar in appearance to domestic swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), are at times dismissed as harmless. For why should one cower before a furry pig when wyverns and manticores prowl the land?<br><br>The boar's appearances, however, are deceiving. Wild boars breathe no fire and carry no venom, true, but they have ushered many a hunter into the next life all the same. So that you may not share their fate, dear reader, read close the following.<br><br>Wild boars live in groups, called packs, of three to five individuals each. When aggravated, they will begin to circle their aggressor until, the moment being ripe, they charge. Wild boars then strike with heads as hard as battering rams and puncture with tusks aimed for the stomach or crotch.<br><br>Some try to slay the boar by approaching it from the rear, but I do not recommend this method: the beast will in such a case strike out its hind legs with such cruel force as to crush bone into dust. Better first to slow the boar with a trap, or, if one is learned in such rites, with a spell, and then try to fight using the power of the elements – for the beasts are particularly vulnerable to fire.

   1139594|776ddc93||Ever since arachnomorphs – commonly known as pitchfiends or knotlegs – first wandered from the east and into the lands of the Northern Realms, much has been said and written about them, and much of this has been none too wise. Bits of this passed-down knowledge have contained a few grains of truth, others, but distant echoes, while others still were clearly pulled out of some pseudo-scholar’s rear end. I therefore feel it my duty, as the most eminent expert on insectoids north of the Yaruga, to separate the truth from the lies, like grain from so much chaff, and share the results with the people.<br><br>Let us begin with the basics. Arachnomorphs are unusually swift, even for arachnids. It is difficult to flee them, on horseback as well as afoot. Even if one does outpace them at first, his rescue is but temporary, for they are able to spew webs from great distance which entangle their victim’s legs in a flash. Larger individuals, mistakenly considered a separate species by some, are in addition especially skillful jumpers.<br><br>The best slayers of arachnomorphs are witchers: by using well-chosen oils and Signs, such as Aard, Yrden or Axii, they are able to face and defeat these creatures. That provides but little comfort to the rest of us, however, for there are fewer and fewer of these monster slayers by the year, while the monsters themselves grow ever greater in number.

I vow to atone for my sins, to walk the path of redemption and rid myself of all that ties me to my old life, so that I may stand proudly among the disciples of the Highest and proclaim myself a new man.<br><br>I shall thus now journey to the Temple of Lebioda, to meet with the Great Beggar, a sage who has pondered the pearls of Lebioda more than any else in this sad vale of tears. I shall listen to his counsel and follow his guidance on my road to absolution.
   1152323|19ab14a5||30 Birke 1201<br>My fellow captive, Merten, who for so many months kept his neck stiff, mocked my faith in Lebioda and praised the joys of a riotous life, today broke down completely. He admitted he had wasted his gods-given time on pleasures of the flesh and all that he had to show for it were chains and indignities. I tried to lift his spirits, to tell him there is another Path, that he can cast off his past habits and devote his life to Lebioda and His teachings. For now, my counsels have fallen on deaf ears, but I believe he will one day convert and listen to the Truth.<br><br>[illegible entry]<br><br>17 Lammas 1202<br>It is shocking how pleasantly I now converse with Merten. It beggars belief to think we once could not bear each other’s presence! He is a man transformed, metamorphosed! I feel he has accepted his new Path. He devours greedily all I tell him about Lebioda and His teachings. What rapture it is that, in this dank and dark dungeon, the Prophet sent me a sinner and gave my life meaning!<br><br>[blotted entry]<br><br>43 Blathe 1203<br>It is over. Merten has served his sentence and left these accursed dungeon walls. The teachings which I have tried to pass on to him during these last dozen months have clearly taken root: Merten has vowed to go on a pilgrimage which will let him cast off his old ways and open the doors for a new life. As I advised, he will go first to the cave where Lebioda received enlightenment and on whose walls he carved four of his Great Truths. I hope the aura of that place will help Merten, as it has helped many before him, achieve cleansing and gain strength to continue his pilgrimage on to his next station, which I advised him should be… [rest illegible]
   1152363|4665fe21||32 Feainn 1203<br>My road has reached its end. I, Merten, having been given as a child to members of the Manticore guild of witchers, having been subjected to their vile mutations and refashioned by their destructive regime of training, do this day cease to be a witcher. I have finished my pilgrimage and divested myself of all that tied me to my old life. I have journeyed to the Hidden Chapel in the Cave of Tribulations and survived. Today, I am born anew. Here, in the Lake of Cleansing, I leave behind the last of the items which signify my attachment to my previous incarnation as a witcher. Along with them I leave behind my cares, my grievances and my obligations. I cast off all that I was, including my name – from now on, I shall answer to Shavel. I am a new man. Thank you, Most Redoubtable Lebioda! <br><br>I feel my new self pushing me onward, to new lands and places which remain hidden from me. The good folk who helped me during my journey always said I must listen to my inner voice and follow it, for it is through that inner voice that Lebioda speaks to us. I shall not go against its will. I will set off, north, to Temeria, Aedirn, perhaps even the Dragon Mountains. I will proclaim the glory of Lebioda and do good deeds – just as the Prophet commanded.
   1152362|60016d66||7 Feainn 1203<br>The attacks have grown more forceful. The residents of the nearby village who oppose my presence become more aggressive by the day. They do not like that I speak the truth about their former deities. They cannot understand they will only find salvation in Lebioda. They threaten me with death, but if I am to die for Lebioda, if that is the destiny the Prophet has marked out for me, I shall fulfill it with a broad smile on my face.<br><br>14 Feainn 1203<br>I have just parted with a most marvelous guest, a true convert, a man of extraordinary yearning for truth and faith. He is called Merten and was once a witcher but has abandoned that dishonorable trade and embarked on the path of truth. We spoke at length and sat together for hours in meditation and prayer. To better honor Lebioda he left behind here many goods which symbolized his attachment to his former life. He has made great progress – oh, If only all the disciples of Lebioda were so fervent in their faith, this world would be a better place!<br><br>Merten confessed to me the bitter truth about the foul deeds he had wrought in his past life. I told him if he is to obtain cleansing, he must go to the Hidden Chapel. Reaching this bleak place, which is carved out of rock and ridden with dangerous creatures, will in itself constitute a challenge and a trial – if Lebioda lets him enter the chapel’s confines, it means he has forgiven his sins, his crimes. And so Merten went… Let Lebioda guide his feet.<br><br>19 Feainn 1203<br>My fate is sealed. I shall die for my faith, for truth, for Lebioda. This night folk from the village, a band of drunken thugs, attacked the temple. With hate and malice on their breath they cried that since I am the Great Beggar, I should now beg Lebioda for mercy. They looted the temple of all its treasures (thankfully leaving the books, which they deemed worthless) and walled me in to wither in a sealed tomb... If Lebioda does not send me help, I will die here. May my bones bear witness to his glory.
   1152364|89ff0535||17 Feainn 1203<br><br>It is done. I have reached the Cave of Tribulations and stepped into the hallowed confines of the Hidden Chapel. Never shall I forget what I have been through… I was attacked by giant fire-breathing creatures, power monstrosities akin to drowners crossed with endregae, men with the faces of wild animals… Yet Lebioda smiled on me and saw fit to let me survive this harrying gauntlet. At its end – here, in the Hidden Chapel – I surrendered myself to meditation and immediately He filled my mind with a vision of a lake whose crystal clear waters surrounded me, penetrated my soul and cleansed it of all wickedness and villainy… when I awoke, I was certain what Lebioda had designated as the last station on my pilgrimage: the Lake of Cleansing, where Lebioda healed the bodies and spirits of his followers. <br><br>Following the advice of the sage known as the Great Beggar, in whose wisdom I basked at the Temple of Lebioda (I pray all is well with him and the people of his village have understood he only speaks the truth and means them no harm), I shall now leave behind further things binding me to my former life. Doing so is not easy, however, for acquiring these diagrams once cost me a great deal of time, energy and sacrifice. But I know this is the right path. Let Lebioda accept my humble offering.<br><br>I now continue onward, towards the Lake of Cleansing. Though my road is difficult and full of sacrifices, it grows ever more straight and clear and I feel a lightness in my soul. My certainty I walk the right path grows strong as iron, firm as steel. Praise be to Lebioda!

   1154902|698eff24||Sir Gareth and Miss Daphne loved each other so much it hurt. To win the approval of his future father-in-law, Gareth had to perform seven challenges.[...]<br><br>The seventh was the hardest. Gareth had to go to Lynx Crag, find the witch who lives there and convince her to lift the drought that plagued the whole land. Everyone, including Daphne, pleaded with Gareth to humble himself before the witch. You see, the witch from Lynx Crag was spiteful and headstrong, even for a witch, and only an act of true humility could break her icy heart.<br><br>Gareth, however, had no intention of bending his knee before a witch. Instead, he planned to force her to lift the curse. Nobody knows what happened on Lynx Crag, but Gareth never returned to his beloved. Daphne stood on the top of a hill and looked for him day and night. Finally, she turned into a tree, so that she may live to see the return of her knight. Such was the strength of her longing and the power of her love.<br><br>Anyone who plunged his axe blade into that tree would see blood run from the wound. Folk started to avoid that place, leaving Daphne in peace to wait for Gareth. In time, all had forgotten about her.

   1147983|01dc5980||In our lands - that is to say, in the fair Duchy of Toussaint - the hunting of basilisks has a long and storied tradition, one reaching back to the dawn of our present history. Attesting to this is a note written by one Xenon of Trytion, a leatherworker, in the year 1023. In it one finds mention of a commission for a corset, to be fastened from “hide of that winged serpent, called basilicus by some” (see Vedetto Fiari, <i>Manuscripts through the Ages</i>, 1278). While lesser hides could come from beasts felled by age or hunger, the costliness and expanse of this corset would have necessitated the skin of a basilisk taken in its prime - and therefore required a hunt.<br><br>Without the engagement of a witcher, or, as a last resort, a knight or a mercenary, such a hunt would have perforce meant the gruesome death of the foolhardy hunter.<br><br>Yet those adept at the task - witchers chief among them - hunted basilisks and their cousins, cockatrices, with great success, thinning their numbers till a mere handful remained.<br><br>To give but one example, in the year 1100 basilisks of the <i>regulus platinum</i> subspecies dotted skies all across our land, yet in the present day only one exemplar still lives.

   1160584|444059e7||Day 1<br>Filibert sent us to collect supplies from the Basane Farm. I stayed with most of the lads in camp as always, and sent a few to go strike a deal with the steward. Hubert Duret’s a reasonable chap, never gave us trouble about taking supplies before, so it seems we’re in for an easy job. Not like hunting flying monsters or lying in wait for caravans coming down the road.<br><br>Day 2<br>Nicolai and Pablo Gaffe have not returned. Something stinks and it’s not my footwraps. I’m taking charge and leading a group to see what’s going on. If those peasants at Basane have done something to my men, I’ll reduce that farm to mouldering ashes.<br><br>Day 3<br>The farm’s been demolished, but no sign of Pablo or Nicolai. We only found two hayseeds – I’ll take them back to camp for questioning. Both howl like madmen and mumble constantly about some werewolf. They’ll cool their heels in a cage for a while, maybe get more talkative. And where the bumblazes are my men?!
   1160463|af5ba726||[Many pages of the journal are filled, but the last is dirtied and written in a chaotic hand]<br><br>It is done… Countess de Sakhor has bought Basane Farm and after so many happy years we have to leave our comfortable abode… When Hubert received the eviction notice, he flew into such a rage it took a great deal for me to calm him. I explained it was already a miracle we’d been able to live so long among men. I fear Hubert will prove unable to control his transformations while he is in such a state…<br><br>We’ve moved into a cave in the Blessure Forest. They allowed us to take a few possessions from the farm. We have a bed, a table and some candles. Things aren’t so bad! The cave is a bit damp, true, and one night in I can already tell it will play havoc with my joints…<br><br>Hubert had an attack when he heard me cough. He screamed he would return to the farm and sink his teeth in the countess... I’ve a bad feeling.<br><br>Hubert has disappeared. I’m terrified. Shivers run down my spine. I can taste blood in my mouth… I fear Hubert has gone off to kill… What will become of us if he loses all control… [the remaining pages are torn out, claw marks visible on the back cover]

If you do not meet our demands, Rhenawedd may soon be missing not only pears, but bread and water also. We will lock her away in a rat-infested dungeon and start to torture her: first, we will pull out her fingernails, then we will break her bones, and finally we will strip her skin off, piece by piece.<br><br>You, however, can save her.

Maybe I will start with a warning: it's pure madness. Assuming that you survive teleportation -- and opening a stable portal several dozen meters above the ground is, as you know, highly risky -- you will then be torn to shreds. As much as Vampires Superiores are actually rational creatures with developed cognitive and analytical functions, other species may be less open to attempts to make contact.<br><br>If by chance you do live to have an audience with this Unseen Elder, do the following immediately: genuflect, say words of greeting in their language -- "eclthi, lautni ama" -- and place on the ground the attached Haakland aragonite crystal as a gift. Then, and only then, is there the slightest chance that you will be heard. But, by the gods, speak quickly and don't waste your words.<br><br>-Jochen Brandt

   1165121|7fc2de3d||It is with great sadness we announce our large-hearted friend, Hughes de Saberre, has unexpectedly shuffled off this mortal coil. He died as he lived - loving and being loved.
   1165127|78161b76||My Darling Pascal,<br><br>I trust this missive finds you in good health. As you know, my affections for you are powerful beyond all measure, and I yearn for you to become my husband with all my being. Soon we shall stand together at the marital altar, but I hope you understand this must be a ceremony to make the duquessa herself green with envy! Do not think this an admonishment in any way, my dear, but we both know your modest soldier’s wage will not allow us to put on the extravagant ball which we both deserve. But do not be sad! I have found a solution to our little problem!<br><br>You surely know about the shipwreck on the bottom of the Sansretour, but I doubt you know the full history of how it came to be there. Back in the time of Duke Raymund, one of the wealthiest men in the duchy, Gaël Sasque, decided to hold a ball in the middle of the river. And what a ball it was… Beautifully coiffed grandes dames, elegant gentlemen in white shirts and striking doublets… Gaël apparently took a crate of jewelry aboard and changed rings multiple times to impress all with his wealth. The event was in full swing when, suddenly, a violent storm rolled in. The wind snapped the masts and capsized the vessel. All the wealthy guests, draped in gold and jewels, sank to the bottom in a flash! This tragic story might yet have a happy ending, however, for I have obtained the key to Gaël Sasque's chest!<br><br>I imagine you know see why our future prosperity is within easy reach. After all, the drowned dead do not need diamonds, am I not right?<br><br>Loving You More Than Life Itself,<br><br>Bella de Gunness

The worst is that I’ve got to document it all, then hide the notes from the guards! Each escape must be noted down in detail – otherwise, my employers won’t have a basis for releasing my pay. The work of a professional escapologist is not easy, my friend.<br><br>25th Day of the Month of Birke<br>This time I was given a contract in Toussaint. This is going to be a piece of cake. The guards are fat and drowsy and the walls pocked... [illegible fragment] I was given a thorough hiding today. Those guards are fat and indolent, true, but they know how to whip. Blast, think I’m getting too old for this. I’ll finish this contract and then it’s time for a change of trades.<br><br>28th Day of the Month of Birke<br>Ha! I’m one lucky whoreson. My fellow inmate, a man wrongfully convicted, told me a story about an elven treasure trove hidden underwater somewhere south of the prison… I believe he sensed I was planning an escape. I’m supposed to take that sly rogue with me in exchange for the key. Perhaps that’s my ticket to an early retirement… [illegible fragment]<br><br>1st Day of the Month of Blathe<br>I completed my dig, only to learn I had miscalculated and exited right into the lake! My companion had not learned to swim, it seems, and now he never will, for he sleeps the big sleep, dreaming of fish. Sadly I didn’t manage to take the key to the elven treasure from him. Took all my strength just to get back to our cell, where a pack of guards were waiting for me. They knocked out a few of my ribs and a handful of teeth, but I should heal.<br><br>11th Day of the Month of Blathe<br>Things’re good. They’ve moved me to another cell. Bars on the window saw the days when elves ran Toussaint, so I’ll loosen those rust-rotten rods this evening and then it’s into the lake. It’s a long drop, true, but that’s no worry for me. Then I’ll report back to my employer and check out that tale about a treasure. If all goes well, I’ll soon be done with escapology!

All the help says the town’s abuzz with talk about missing spoons, for much time now, indeed. Since this creature has stolen cutlery from all Beauclair and has not yet been caught by our valiant guard, it means it must be clever. Tricky, even. And anyone clever can be swayed by arguments. Especially financial ones! So I asked my jeweler, Maathenberg, to make me a spoon out of pure gold which I shall take to the Caroberta Woods, to find that monster and propose a trade: a spoon of gold for my most precious spoon!

Unfortunately, I must note that they did not behave in a manner becoming for young ladies: there were fisticuffs! Anna Henrietta was first to hit her sister, but Syanna didn't wait long to reply. Before I could break them apart, little Anarietta had lost two milk teeth, and she ran straight to her parents to complain. His Grace the Duke couldn't believe his ears when I told him what had happened. Syanna got the whole blame and was suitably punished. Anarietta then tried to ease the situation, but the Duke and Duchess were resolute.<br><br>-III-<br><br>Today for the first time I accompanied the girls to the Land of a Thousand Fables, where we spent half a day. First we played with Thumbelina and then with Redbeard, who was extremely gallant for a highwayman. I am thoroughly impressed by what the master Artorius Vigo has achieved.

The girls said that if I wish to go there by myself, all I have to do is open the book Land of a Thousand Fables and say out loud the spell: Expecto ludum!<br><br>-IV-<br><br>Today, Syanna was tested by the mages sent by the Chapter. I don't know what conclusions they drew, but His Grace the Duke is clearly worried. I asked the Duke what awaits the princess. He didn't reply.<br><br>-V-<br><br>I tutored the girls in Nilfgaardian today. Syanna applies herself so, though she has great difficulty memorizing new vocabulary. Lady Anarietta seems more gifted in this regard, yet also prone to impish behavior. When she thought me out of earshot, she called me a 'bloede kusse.'

I suspect they are but common criminals looking for something shiny to steal and have no real interest in my research, but better safe than sorry.<br><br>[illegible fragment]<br><br>...furthermore, on the advice of an engineer acquaintance of mine, I have decided to secure the premises with a simple mechanical apparatus. In one of the rooms along the route to the laboratory, I have installed a mechanism for locking and unlocking the doors which is operated by pressing four protruding stones placed high up on the walls. I can bypass this lock with ease by using a simple spell, but a common thief will be faced with a double challenge – first he must notice these stones and puzzle out their purpose, then, he must find a way to press them…<br><br>[illegible fragment]
   1171504|1a6d71e5||My Dear Friend,<br><br>I've been told you're on a jaunt to Toussaint. I do hope you don't overtax yourself during the Wine Festival. The effects of such exertion at your age can indeed prove most detrimental.<br><br>I've come upon some information which might be of interest to you. While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery. Yet his journal should at least provide hints as to both. It is said he was laid to rest with it in his tomb.<br><br>I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.<br><br>Should you grow tired of sampling Beauclair's ladies, wines and other exquisite delicacies, this matter might prove a fruitful diversion. Investigate at your leisure.<br><br>Your friend, Yennefer.

   1171503|606560e1||My Dear Geralt,<br><br>I hope all is well. I imagine you hot on the trail of some nasty monster - or is it an overly complex curse this time? Oh Geralt, I wish I knew for certain…<br><br>Whatever is keeping you busy, perhaps you'll need a break. For those moments I offer you this intriguing little mystery I happened on in an old manuscript I bought off a merchant from Nazair.<br><br>The tome's author claims a certain Professor Moreau once called Beauclair home. And this professor conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>I don't know much else, but I suspect that alone might pique your interest. The tome mentioned a journal interred with the scholar when he passed. It could very well lead you to his laboratory.<br><br>I'm enclosing a map I found folded in the tome. It's smudged in a few places, but I hope it proves useful anyway.<br><br>Please be careful and come back to me quickly.<br><br>Your Triss.
   1171502|500e55aa||Dearest,<br><br>I suspect weighty affairs, rather than merely the Wine Festival, have drawn you to Toussaint. Perhaps you'll find time to probe a certain matter in spite of this.<br><br>I recently came across the mention of one Professor Moreau, a scholar in Beauclair who conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>Though the details are rather murky, as is the location of the scholar's laboratory, his journal could contain more information. It lies buried with him in his tomb.<br><br>I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.<br><br>I felt this matter could prove of some importance to you, thus I dispatched this letter without delay. Whatever you decide, please take exceedingly good care of yourself.<br><br>Your Yen.

You’ve adopted a diddling panther? A few of our men came back to camp with their bums so bitten they’ll have to doodoo standing up for weeks, and the very thought of going back on patrol has them shaking so hard their seams burst. This can’t go on. Heard you’ve even gone so daffy as to give it a name. Hobbes the panther?

These are noonwraiths – the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    432587|00000000||Ciri's trail took Geralt to Novigrad, the largest city in the North. It would take seas of ink to describe the city accurately, so suffice it to say it is the seat of the Church of the Eternal Fire, a bustling port city and a haven for artists… and all sorts of other shady characters.<br><br>Yet Novigrad at this time was not the city Geralt knew from his earlier travels. War raged throughout the known world, and rich cities often prove tempting morsels to armies on the march. It was clear at this time that this particular morsel had both Radovid and Emhyr greedily licking their chops. Within the city, the Temple Guard acted with impunity under the command of a cankerous snot named Caleb Menge and with the support of that terror-spreading band of zealots, the witch hunters. Meanwhile, the kingpins of the city's underworld still held much of it in their sleazy grasp.<br><br>Finding Ciri here would be like searching for a needle in a burning haystack - Geralt would clearly need some assistance. Luckily, an old acquaintance of his now lived in Novigrad. Her name was Triss Merigold.<br>
    441253|e3a31e17||What worries me most, brothers and sisters, is our moral decay. Townsmen disdain their marital beds, instead seeking out loose women to fulfill their manly desires. Their wives return the favor and look for any opportunity to cuckold them. Their children are either born bastards or dispatched with the help of witches. More folk flock to the so-called pleasure houses than to our temple, despite the fact that within their walls one is more likely to find rot than any pleasure. Men sleep with men, women with women, humans with nonhumans.<br><br>"What next?" I ask you. What will our depravity bring? Will man marry goat? Will premarital intercourse become a commonplace affair? No, brothers and sisters! The Eternal Fire must burn away these sins! The Fire - and only the Fire - can cleanse us!

    469954|06b28b45||Among the many faiths of the Nordlings, the most widespread is the cult of Melitele, a goddess who takes three forms: young girl, mature woman and old crone. Melitele is a Mother Goddess who cares for her children. Primarily women pray to her, though men in need might also utter supplications. The religion is a vestige of the old matriarchy and testifies to the weakness of the Nordlings - people who worship female deities are soft-hearted and incapable of preparing their sons for war.<br><br>In recent years, the cult of Melitele has found a rival in the cult of the Eternal Fire, which came out of Novigrad. Clerics of the Eternal Fire demonstrate fanaticism and almost complete devotion. The religion is hostile toward any form of otherness, including nonhumans. The Order of the Flaming Rose is the cult's military arm.<br><br><br><br>The treatise also examines other faiths, including the cult of the Lionhead Spider.

    519864|46072d3c||Most historians ascribe the trial, sentencing and execution of Joachim de Wett to the violent, cruel and tyrannical nature of Emperor Emhyr, although many authors with a predilection for sensationalizing propose loaded hypotheses about vengeance and the settling of thoroughly private scores. It is high time to tell the truth – a truth that is and has long been more than clear to every scholar.<br><br>Duke de Wett led the Verden Group. To describe the manner in which he did so as “incompetent” would be far too kind. Facing a force half as strong as his own, he delayed the northern offensive, turning all his attention to the fight against the guerillas of Verden.<br><br>The Verden Group brought unheard of cruelties to bear against the civilian population. The result proved as predictable as it was inevitable - whereas in winter the insurgents numbered a mere half thousand, by spring nearly the entire country had taken up arms against us. King Ervyll, a loyal liege subject to the Empire, was killed, and his son, Crown Prince Kistrin, who sympathized with the Nordlings, was made king.<br><br>With Skellige raiders biting at his flanks, a Nordling offensive coming from Cidaris before him, and a rebellion at his rear, de Wett became bogged down in a chaotic struggle and suffered one defeat after another. This in turn delayed Army Group Center's offensive – instead of pinning down the Nordlings’ flanks as it was to, the Verden Group tied down Menno Coehoorn. The Nordlings took advantage of the situation immediately. They mounted a counter-offensive, breaking through the ring of forces encircling Mayena and Maribor, and thwarting any chance for the quick recapture of these important fortresses. De Wett’s incompetence ineptitude and stupidity also affected morale. The myth of an invincible Nilfgaard was shattered. New recruits began to pour into the armies of the North by the hundreds…

When Geralt and Graden descended down into it, they found a collection of dolls with various items attached to them. They tried to lift the curse by removing the doll that represented Anna, but their efforts ended in catastrophe - Anna's curse was lifted, but she died soon afterwards, for the Crones had constructed it to leave death as its parting gift. Following her mother's death, Tamara returned to Oxenfurt, her spirits crushed. The baron, in no less foul a mood, went back to Crow's Perch.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Casteldaccia vineyard – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the ruins of the castle atop Mont Crane. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Filibert Fourfingers, wanted by writ of law in Belhaven, Metinna and Nazair, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 30% to take into account resort fees and immediate payment in species.

   1147983|01dc5980||In our lands - that is to say, in the fair Duchy of Toussaint - the hunting of basilisks has a long and storied tradition, one reaching back to the dawn of our present history. Attesting to this is a note written by one Xenon of Trytion, a leatherworker, in the year 1023. In it one finds mention of a commission for a corset, to be fastened from “hide of that winged serpent, called basilicus by some” (see Vedetto Fiari, <i>Manuscripts through the Ages</i>, 1278). While lesser hides could come from beasts felled by age or hunger, the costliness and expanse of this corset would have necessitated the skin of a basilisk taken in its prime - and therefore required a hunt.<br><br>Without the engagement of a witcher, or, as a last resort, a knight or a mercenary, such a hunt would have perforce meant the gruesome death of the foolhardy hunter.<br><br>Yet those adept at the task - witchers chief among them - hunted basilisks and their cousins, cockatrices, with great success, thinning their numbers till a mere handful remained.<br><br>To give but one example, in the year 1100 basilisks of the <i>regulus platinum</i> subspecies dotted skies all across our land, yet in the present day only one exemplar still lives.

   1208763|02e0c85b||…While in the stunning duchy of Toussaint, one should not forget to visit Castel Ravello, whose grapes lend their vibrant flavor to wines such as Erveluce, Fiorano, Pomino and the famous Est Est. Should white wine be one's beverage of choice, I wholeheartedly recommend the excellent offerings of two fiercely competing vineyards, Coronata and Vermentino. If one seeks Beauclair White, popular in the North, one should seek out the Castel Toricella vineyard, which produces and exports it. Unfortunately, a severe economic crisis led to the bankruptcy of several distinguished vineyards such as Corvo Bianco, known as Gwyn Cerbin in the Elder Speech (oh, their supreme Sepremento…!) and Tufo. Let us hope each and every one of them finds a passionate new owner who will restore them to their former glory…

When they found he had no coin to collect, they murdered him alongside all other residents of his estate. As if that were not heinous enough, they then made the vineyard their base, from which they would hijack transports of wine to fuel their drunken orgies. So fierce and well-stocked were they, none could chase them off - until one brave alchemist spiced a transport crossing their territory with a powerful extract of ricin.

   1198802|051fb384||The most important aspect of raising human livestock is to provide the herd with conditions that, on the one hand, guarantee their survival, but, on the other hand, do not extend too far beyond the minimum needed for that survival. It should be borne in mind that people are creatures bestowed with great intelligence, or rather cunning and instincts that allow them to gain as much as possible from their environment. In terms of husbandry, this means humans will always try to obtain more than we give them. It is recommended, therefore, to provide each individual with a place to sleep, a meal twice a day and permanent access to water. These conditions, which might seem overly luxurious to some, ensure the optimal production of high quality hemoglobin (more details on diet in later chapters). Also essential is access to air, without which humans die within minutes.<br><br>There is no need to be concerned about the ability for human livestock to multiply in the conditions described above. If they are ensured a minimal existence and male and females are mixed, they will copulate irrespective of whether they are in captivity or not.<br><br>It is worth mentioning here that there is a school of thought that suggests treating human livestock with greater freedom and care, including providing them with better quality fodder and a certain degree of freedom. This allegedly ensures a greater amount of favorable elements in the blood and makes it tastier, however, it is worth mentioning that this method of husbandry is much more difficult and requires emotional bonding techniques, which will be discussed in the following chapters.

Though they maintain a facade of independence and altruism, the knights errant of Toussaint of our day are paid, and by the Duchess herself! So I ask – is that noble? Is that dignified?! Should a knight, a nobleman after all, receive payment for his heroic deeds?! Is he but a mercenary or, pardon my Nazairi, a ploughing witcher? Shouldn’t the tears of joy of a rescued damsel suffice as a reward? I simply cannot understand it! To paraphrase the weighty words of the wise Renè de Hospitalier – such fools, these Toussaintois.

They cost a fortune and left me with barely enough funds to pay the rent for my laboratory, but now I can begin my work in earnest. I’ll soon show those pea-brained admirals of ours that airborne armies are the future of warfare! And the first such army shall be my creation, and shall proudly bear the name of the Redanian Air Force!<br><br>They’ve hatched. Never seen harpies so tiny and – dare I say? – cute. They have no bosoms yet, but do have enormous heads and equally enormous appetites. Bird-like, through and through.<br><br>My first attempts at taming them have brought promising results. The young harpies eat out of our hands, and sometimes eat our hands as well – my assistant’s already lost 2 fingers.<br><br>The ealdorman of Heddel came skittering into our tower, desperately bawling about spiders plaguing in his village, begging for our help, weeping for their picked-upon livestock and offspring, who suffer the most from the arachnoids' bites. Hmph. One swarm of mindless eating machines preying on another. How dare he interrupt my work on the <i>Wunderwaffe</i> for such banalities?! Instead of the arachnocide he requested, I gave him a bottle of arachnomorph pheromones. Won’t he be in for a surprise. But do the peasants not say “spiders and snakes a happy home make”? I’m sure I've heard them say something of the sort.<br><br>Our funds are nearly exhausted. I shall be forced to take something from the rainy day stash I hid from Hubert in the top floor of the tower. The bulk of our outflow goes towards the purchase of pork, which the harpies devour in gargantuan quantities. Perhaps if we were to dress one up in Redanian armor now and present it at court, the king himself would become our patron?<br><br>No, no, no! The entire squadron must be present, else Radovid will deem the whole undertaking a farce!<br><br>It seems our harpies have grown tired of pork. I found the scraps of Hubert’s overalls in one of their cages. No great loss. Hubert had already lost 8 fingers feeding them. Couldn't even grip a broom.<br><br>Catastrophe has struck! Someone opened all the cages and let out the harpies! I’m sure I’ll find them wheezing their last in the grass outside the tower – after all, no one has fed them for a week…

Introduced himself as a biologist. Fellow made a bad impression on me from the start. Short, thin, with a hunched back. Spectacles thick as wine bottles perched on his nose. Had to grin and bear it, though, for he was willing to pay generously (and in species) to rent the tower, first three months delivered in advance. The owner agreed, so what could I do? But I was curious about this "biologist" and wanted to learn what he wanted a whole tower for. He was cagey at first, then let slip, giddy with excitement, that he planned to rear harpies. “You don't rear harpies!” I cried, but he retorted that he'd soon change that and his tamed, tower-bred harpies would prove their use in warfare. Sure, I can see it already: winged vermin donning the Redanian red, flying off all in a row… I swear, if I've ever heard a bigger load of rubbish, my name ain't Rohn Drump!<br><br>[A few pages have been ripped out and… pecked?]<br><br>Vogel's late with the rent.

The learned gent's here, though. Thing is, he's dead. Something vicious sliced open his gut and dragged his innards all over the room… and that's not the worst part – in the workshop's backroom, there's an open cellar filled with half-eaten human corpses! The stank of death's unbearably strong, fills the whole tower. Don't give a rat’s arse anymore about the rent he owes. I’m getting the blazes out of here before something gets me, too…

The witcher you described does indeed seem dangerous – and you yourself always told me they are all freaks and cold-hearted murderers.<br><br>Yet despite all that, I still think you should agree to his offer.

And that, I know, is what you value above all else.<br><br>Going to the bandits who dwell in the ruins of Arthach Palace for protection is a wise move. If the knights could not get the best of them, a witcher will also feel duly cowed in their presence. Shady miscreants of all types always respect each other. Still, be extra careful during that meeting. Bandits and witchers are not to be trusted.<br><br>Yours Truly,<br>Belinda de Launay

   1208693|0e7f3970||[notes written in blood on a scrap of fabric]<br><br>On this scrap rent from my own garment, using my own blood and a fragment of bone from some unknown creature, I write a summary of my sad tale, for I shall surely perish forthwith. Perhaps one day a bard shall happen upon it and compose from it a ballad to squeeze tears from the most pitiless miser.<br><br>Some time ago I spied a monster roaming in proximity to my estate. Upon further investigation, I learned it was a she-troll, descended from the Gorgon Foothills. I thus scraped together a few crowns and went to the camerlengo, to request he hire a knight errant to slay the monstrosity. Yet as I was making this journey, said she-troll sprang out of the bushes, knelt down by my horse and professed something in the garbled speech of trolls that I took to mean she had chosen me as her beau. Since it is most ill-bred to be rude to a lady, even a monstrous one, I declined her politely and was ready to be on my way when she tossed a sack over me, tucked me under her arm and carried me here, to this clearing. She locked me in a cage and stared at me for hours, sending creeping shivers down my spine… So now I slowly starve to death, for while she gives me clear water to drink, my only food is the soup that she-troll spends all day brewing, a foul concoction reeking of carrion and onion. I would rather perish than put that slurry to my lips…

   1205767|0ecfc544||Ding my dong, today we drink to the last drop – or till we drop! Fourfingers had us pitch camp near Delenfer Pass, and to keep from going daffy with boredom we set out on a little reconnaissance mission and happened across a merchant caravan. Sadly, we got a bit carried away – instead of gagging and hog-tying them, the lads sharpened some stakes and stuck the fat feckers on them. That was terribly exhausting work, but we had good fun doing it, and no cleft kisser can take that away. There was one skinny snipe amongst them, but we left him for later. What matters is, their wagons were packed full of quality wine just begging to be guzzled!<br><br>Naturally we established watches, so not everyone would get shloshed at once, as is only common sense. My fool of a papa used to say: Sonny, the most important thing in life’s to like your job. Do that, you’ll be happy. That feeble pate was a carpenter. No tart-twiddling idea what he liked about smacking at wood, but bumbotch him anyways. Geezer’s been pushing daisies for ages now. And if he were alive, I’d write him a letter like this: Papa, I like my work. A whole lot. And thanks for teaching me to read and write, because now I can let you know I give absolutely zero fecks about your advice.

They possess a will of their own and are intelligent, though not in the way of men. For there is no way to fathom their drives and intentions.<br><br>Genies, the most powerful of the elemental spirits, prove the most difficult for men to commune with. Only the true masters of magic have perfected this art, which demands long years of study and risky experiments. Yet even the most adept at the magic arts cannot tame a genie, merely force it to perform certain acts against its own volition.<br><br>They say the mage Stammelford once commanded a d’ao to move a mountain blocking the view from his tower, but even he could never convince a genie to be a willing helpmate in his work or to give sound advice, for the reasoning of these creatures is beyond human understanding.

Duchess Anna Henrietta is the rightful ruler of the region, but in practice she submits to the will of her dearest elder cousin - Emhyr var Emreis. It was certainly out of concern for Her Enlightened Grace and her little realm that the emperor founded an embassy in Toussaint, consisting of a handful of dignitaries who dwell in the duchy full-time and use their experience to help with her, de facto enlightened, decisions.

The druid suggested he raise martens, which love to feed on that insect's larvae. Stefan duly took the druid’s advice and soon eradicated the plague not only in his own vineyard, but in all the neighboring ones as well. In return for this bounteous deed, he was awarded a noble title. He chose a blue wolf to adorn his crest, after deciding he would look foolish parading about with a marten on his shield.

Waltharius then embarked on a lengthy campaign and returned to find his wife in carnal relations with his relative, upon which he flew into a rage and murdered them both. The moral of the tale is held to be that nothing good ever comes from Nazair, and that when one has a young wife, one should stay at home instead of gallivanting about on campaigns.

   1152323|19ab14a5||30 Birke 1201<br>My fellow captive, Merten, who for so many months kept his neck stiff, mocked my faith in Lebioda and praised the joys of a riotous life, today broke down completely. He admitted he had wasted his gods-given time on pleasures of the flesh and all that he had to show for it were chains and indignities. I tried to lift his spirits, to tell him there is another Path, that he can cast off his past habits and devote his life to Lebioda and His teachings. For now, my counsels have fallen on deaf ears, but I believe he will one day convert and listen to the Truth.<br><br>[illegible entry]<br><br>17 Lammas 1202<br>It is shocking how pleasantly I now converse with Merten. It beggars belief to think we once could not bear each other’s presence! He is a man transformed, metamorphosed! I feel he has accepted his new Path. He devours greedily all I tell him about Lebioda and His teachings. What rapture it is that, in this dank and dark dungeon, the Prophet sent me a sinner and gave my life meaning!<br><br>[blotted entry]<br><br>43 Blathe 1203<br>It is over. Merten has served his sentence and left these accursed dungeon walls. The teachings which I have tried to pass on to him during these last dozen months have clearly taken root: Merten has vowed to go on a pilgrimage which will let him cast off his old ways and open the doors for a new life. As I advised, he will go first to the cave where Lebioda received enlightenment and on whose walls he carved four of his Great Truths. I hope the aura of that place will help Merten, as it has helped many before him, achieve cleansing and gain strength to continue his pilgrimage on to his next station, which I advised him should be… [rest illegible]

The effects of such exertion at your age can indeed prove most detrimental.<br><br>I've come upon some information which might be of interest to you. While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.<br><br>The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery. Yet his journal should at least provide hints as to both. It is said he was laid to rest with it in his tomb.<br><br>I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.<br><br>Should you grow tired of sampling Beauclair's ladies, wines and other exquisite delicacies, this matter might prove a fruitful diversion.

   1123009|1ab58eb2||That makes three days we’ve been stationed here in Deadwight Wood. 'Tis a gravely important mission. That’s what the commander told us. "We only send the best of the best to Deadwight Wood” – those were his words. I’m damned proud. Strange enough, there ain’t many trees around and not a corpse to be seen. Maybe the Master’s information was out of date and the peasants have felled the whole wood. Thomas says it’s because we went the wrong way, but he can’t read nor write, so I’m not about to trust him. I’m going out to scout around a bit myself after dinner today. I want to draw up a map of these lands, ‘cause the commander didn’t give us one.

I've sent three units in search of victuals: two groups, six knights each, watch the highroads, three have taken to hunting in the Buckholt Hills. Following Master Urlich's advice, I've sent Peter of Nayhaer’s unit to Deadwight Wood. That lot shouldn’t cause us any more trouble.

Told them they were to do bit of reconnaissance, but that was all hogwash. We’d finished scouting that place out long ago and know the Wood's a deadly trap. That’s why I gathered up the worst of my lot, the ones who don’t do a lick of good to make up for the cost of feeding them, and sent them to a certain death. I know, I hear you asking: is it a dolt’s fault he’s a dolt? Well, these cretins could prove a serious threat to us in battle. During the last skirmish with Radovid’s reapers, two of those idiots failed to recognize our emblems on our shields in the heat of battle and attacked our own men.

   1209965|1e708c97||In the sun-drenched duchy of Toussaint, near the Coronata vineyard, lay the estate of Baronet Hubert Balaste, an honorable knight in the service of Duchess Ademarta. Hubert served as a knight errant for many years and vows were his greatest delight. He swore to do things so grand they curdled blood of other knights. The duchess finally recognized his courage and not only awarded him with an honorary title, but also granted him land. Hubert thus had a place of his own on which to settle down and wait till his time came with dignity. He could find himself a wife and sire descendants as befits every self-respecting hero.<br><br>Unfortunately, once he had lain down his sword and shield, Baronet Balaste began to seek other diversions. And so he indulged in games of card and dice – and at times even bet on dog fights. Then, one day, when fortune abandoned him, he decided to bet not one or two gold pouches, but in fact his family’s entire estate. And he lost. Everything. To add to this already unhappy state of affairs, Hubert Balaste, who was not one to take defeat lightly, flew into a fit of blind passion, donned his armor and enlisted at once. Fortune alas smiled no more favorably upon him at war than it did at play, and an arrow found its way to Hubert’s leg. Then he died of gangrene.

By the power of said decree, each knight thus rendering aid will be rewarded according as per the following: a remuneration of the “Heron” type (in the case of aid in a battle against one human opponent) or of the “Crane” type (in the case of aid in a battle against more than one human opponent or a nonhuman opponent), to be paid from the funds of the knight receiving aid within one fiscal month.<br>Above-mentioned “Crane”-type remuneration has been awarded to the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who lent assistance to Sir Daniel Dubois. Sir Dubois was traversing the area near the lake known as Seidhe Llygad for therapeutic-recreational purposed (prescribed by a druidic healer from Caed Myrkvid) when he was attacked by 2 (in words: two) members of the criminal organization run by Graybill Pellegrin. While providing assistance, the witcher eradicated these “vandaguilders” (colloquial term for organized criminals plying the plunder trade), pursuant to Her Illustrious Grace’s Order of March 24th, 1264, on the Protection of the Borderlands.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 19% to take into account the tax on equine emissions and immediate payment in species.

Tomorrow we shall set out to the Blessure Forest, but before embarking I invited my guide to a supper at the Pheasantry – we will be spending several days together, after all, and I’d like to get to know him better. Luq turned out to be a picky gentleman. The chef de cuisine served us veal cutlets in garlic sauce and Gessenese bean soup. Luq, however, asked for pancakes and red wine, making excuses about an inborn distaste for garlic. He also didn’t touch the silver cutlery, explaining something about an allergy and making use of his own wooden set instead. Despite these oddities, he made for quite interesting company and we chatted over a bottle (bottles, to be precise) of wine until late in the night. Something tells me there will soon be much talk of the Votty Gerek - Luq Veunèque duo in the world of speleologists!

So desirable are barrels made from this wood, it seemed loggers would cut the duchy clear until protests from angry druids stopped them. After years of negotiations, a compromise was reached and a special organization, the Coopers’ Guild, was created. Thanks to its strict supervision of the industry, logging became sustainable and it became the richest guild in the city – as evinced by the proud gate it funded.

   1206896|2b5520a9||(...) In recent decades, many of us have come to believe that a much more effective way of obtaining good quality human blood than hunting individuals is their systematic, controlled husbandry. Apart from the obvious advantages, such as being able to control what the flock eats and the ability to crossbreed specific individuals to obtain offspring with the best hemoglobin, another clear advantage to breeding human flocks is that domesticated humans held in confinement, as opposed to those in their natural habitat (i.e. "villages" and "towns"), become less aggressive, and therefore less troublesome.<br><br>When it comes to farming humans, there are various schools, of which two seem to have gained the widest acceptance in recent times - namely battery-cage and free-range husbandry. This thesis describes in detail the advantages and disadvantages as well as the methods of carrying out each type of breeding. As an introduction, it is worth mentioning the basic differences between both types.<br><br>Battery-cage human husbandry (described very accurately and in detail in the book <i>Human Husbandry</i>) is the placing of several male and female individuals in a closed, restricted space, with permanent access to air, food and water. This form of breeding differs from free range in that the flock is not permitted to leave the breeding area and is held captive the entirety of their lives.<br><br>Free-range, on the other hand, involves leaving the flock in its natural habitat or creating a habitat that simulates it closely (i.e. creating villages, more on which can be found in the chapter - Human Villages: Establishing and Growing a Herd), and then making the herd psychologically or physically dependent on its owner. The most effective method for making a human individual dependent is guaranteeing it safety and permanent access to high quality feed. It is worth adding that a human that trusts its owner does not feel fear and does not defend itself when having its blood drunk, which limits the production of noradrenaline and cortisol, which have a negative impact on the taste of the blood. Furthermore, it may happen that a domesticated free-range human may feel a certain pleasure when its owner drinks its blood (most likely associated with sexual tension), which causes an intensification in the blood's flavor.

Some even called for the walls to be torn down altogether – for what had they to fear, with their town protected by the bravest knights errant the world has ever known?

Apparently, everyone who has tried to act out Elsa’s scene on that amphitheater’s stage has died in mysterious circumstances. Old wives’ tales. Even if it is haunted, I believe Elsa’s spirit will give me its blessing!<br><br>7th of Feainn<br>Tonight, I set out! I have prepared candles and acquired two bottles of the very same wine Elsa drank right before her death! I will rehearse and rehearse and rehearse! Until at last I feel, I believe, indeed, I AM Elsa!<br><br>[fragment of a script, highlighted in red ink]<br><br>The day now dies. It collapses into itself, as does my soul… Darkness like a stifling vapor shall soon swallow me. No! Now I am at last ready to renew the memory of ghosts in my heart.<br><br>I shall light the candles.<br><br>Let the first flicker for the lad, a mere child, who was smitten and perished on the field of battle at high noon without a murmur.<br>Let now the second flicker for he who wished to fetch me a jewel from the bottom of the well, and never surfaced to see the light of this world again.<br>Let the third flicker for the husband – handsome as a  statue, cold as a stone! – who left me alone and in darkness departed. Anonymously he died, in the woods, he perished.<br>Let the fourth flicker for he who loved so beautifully, so heatedly delighted and in this fire was consumed.<br>Let the fifth flicker for you, my beloved, my faithful companion, my hapless husband! Wracked by disease! You lie in the earth most shallowly of all.<br>All candles now flicker.<br>So lovely, so white.<br>Men, boys, husbands – mine, all! I love you to the last.<br><br>Now behold the wine. I drink it and with it sanctify your memory.

   1135677|2d8a7143||Some two hundred and forty years ago, a certain Josen Garin arrived in these lands. A Haaki traveler, writer, brawler and souse, Garin looked around and saw the local meadows in bloom, cool shadows beneath charming glades, and glorious sun-bathed fields. All this inspired him to settle down here for good. His new neighbors treated the arrival with suspicion, yet they changed their minds and warmed to him once he turned a gracious host who would fill their cups once and again with the exquisite wines he had brought with him from his homeland.

   1202087|2ed855e9||Dear Hadewiga,<br><br>You were absolutely correct to advise against this journey. Why did the Dean of Archeology entrust its leadership to the hands of this quadroon? Who found the Violet Ruby of Aed Gynvael, me or her?<br><br>You must know the witcher has returned after all! The Ruby removed the barrier (as I held it would from the start!) and allowed him to explore the interior. Can you believe the witcher almost convinced that Duchamp to return to town to hire additional guards?! “We don’t know what dangers are in store for us.” Now there’s someone who knows how to pad his billable hours! Duchamp took to the idea, recalling the tale about the tomb being cursed. Yet I convinced the company not to put any stock in fairy tales. We must hurry, I said, for what if someone beats us to it and robs the elven treasury first? Because as you know, according to my translation the “most precious” can only mean one thing – the lost treasure of King Divethaf! Soon it shall be ours! (blood stains)<br><br>(later addendum partly obscured by blood stains)<br>The witcher was right. We should never have gone in there. That is an accursed place! I barely managed to escape, crawl out and take the Ruby. The portal has closed. I am safe, but the others… <br><br>

As per our earlier correspondence, I would like to commission from you a geological survey to use in determining in which location we shall find the most fitting soil for expanding our vineyard’s acreage.

The mind of man cannot comprehend this land, where non-geometric space and blasphemous colors fly in the face of everything our eyes are accustomed to. In that instant, in the moment of my arrival, I teetered on the verge of madness. I shouted a noiseless cry and sweat bloody sweat when two suns rose above my head. I fell to my knees and prayed to Zhothaqquah not for salvation, but for a quick death.<br><br>And then They came…

As mentioned above, when the leaves of this herb are placed against the flesh, they heal all kinds of trauma, wounds and sores. Brew it, and the resulting tincture treats the common cold, colic and loss of appetite. Yet in addition to their healing properties, the branches of the yarrow plant can be used for fortune telling. This method of divination might seem strange upon first glance, but is in truth simple and effective. It truly allows one to focus on the query at hand and gain an answer both accurate and satisfying.

   1205837|32953dcb||Maximus Macrinus was once a knight errant famed for showing no mercy to any bandits prowling the Champs-Désolés. After a long and storied career, he hung up his sword at his ancestral manor and settled in for a well-deserved retirement. No one knows what brought about the subsequent murder of his entire family. Some claim a giant descended from the mountains, others, that he ran afoul of one of the larger hanses. The only undisputed fact is that everyone with any sense now avoids going anywhere near Casteldaccia.

   1208407|334c83d2||The transmutation of bodies is one of the most difficult tasks any mage can undertake – indeed, only the true masters of the Art have ever accomplished it, and even they have only perfected one of its forms. This difficulty arises from psychophysical limitations, since a mage can only safely transform into an animal with which he is perfectly attuned. A famous example is that of Ulf Blackbeard, who dwelled for years in a cave with a bear in order to imbibe the life essence of that animal.

   1206695|33cb6a09||Amadeus Cianfanelli was born to a family of humble traders, but, thanks to hard work and innate entrepreneurial talent, by the age of fifty he had already established a flourishing bank. It soon became clear, however, that for the ambitious Amadeus, this was just the beginning. He quickly expanded the business, establishing Cianfanelli Bank branches in Kovir and Nazair and even sending a representative to Zerrikania. He became known for treating each and every customer as an old friend and cared deeply about what became of others’ coin. He thus created a wide range of banking products to better allow him to look after the property of an increasingly greater number of customers. He coined the phrase that up until today has served Cianfanelli as an advertising slogan and motto: “We look after your coin as if it were our own.”

   1205858|34965e7d||At Belgaard Vineyard, a famous act of poisoning once occurred which took the lives of a large gang of bandits who were ransacking the area. The folk charged with cleaning up in the aftermath originally planned to burn the bodies, but one pious soul thought even rotten dung-diddlers such as they deserve better. He thus paid for their bodies to be laid to rest in a small cemetery: Mère-Lachaiselongue. Later, Sir Ramon of Gichon died a martyr’s death here while trying to get rid of the bandits’ constantly returning wraiths.

As befits one of my station and familial connections I was sent to study at Ban Ard, the famed school for mages, yet I was never to complete those studies. For the entire duration of my life magic held but a weak hold over a soul ravished by a passion for organic alchemy. It was to that most wondrous of sciences I dedicated the most beautiful years of my life, and the table beside which you now most surely stand is the fruit of those labors of love.<br><br>If you are a fellow lover of alchemy, I hazard to guess you will be filled with rapture to behold my discovery. If, however, that marvelous science is unknown to you, please heed my advice – drop this letter, step away from the table and never return. The practice of alchemy by amateurs can lead to injury and even death.<br><br>If you did not drop this letter after that last paragraph, you are no stranger to alchemy – thus I shall now reveal to you in a few brief words the fundaments of the alchemy table I designed. Leaving aside all unnecessary detail, my chief discovery consisted of a formula and tools allowing for the transmutation of mutagens taken from monsters into mutagens of the more common sort. I know this sounds highly unlikely, but I have proven with utmost certainty that this is possible.<br><br>The workings of this transmutation are simple – one must simply make use of the table which I designed. As an expert in the arcane art of alchemy, you certainly already know your way around such devices. If you are but an amateur, a member of the hoi polloi who has by accident wandered to this abandoned place – back away, lest your ignorance do your grievous harm.<br><br>You are surely asking yourself why I hid my discovery from the world, why I did not share my formula with the community of alchemists… Well, let us say I have forever been regarded as eccentric, aloof. And I have always believed it is pure chance and not men themselves that determine destiny. Furthermore, I have never sired offspring and have no desire to entrust my opus to a mere acquaintance. I thus concluded the best solution was to hide my table and trust that chance will – if my theory is correct – bring a man here who shall know how to make use of it, whom it shall delight and to whom it will prove of great use. Whether I am right or wrong – time will tell.<br><br>Use my gift wisely and fare you well,<br>Julius ban Gavh'e, alchemist

Bottles bearing its famed labels are worth fortunes and even grace the tables of kings - indeed, today one can barely imagine a royal feast without Côte-de-Blessure or Est Est. And it is here, at Beauclair’s port, that this wine begins its journey both to the south – into the heart of the Nilfgaardian Empire – and to the far-off North.

   1207185|36434bb4||Corvo Bianco’s origins have been lost to the mists of time. We have only a bare legend about the vineyard being founded by the owner of the Pomerol estate’s son, who had been disinherited and exiled with only a Carvanere sapling to his name.<br><br>The modern history of Corvo Bianco begins with Master Bolius, who settled in the vineyard in his elder years. As a young man, Bolius had headed a division of sappers which fought in the far north. For his service, he was made a noble and awarded a great deal of coin. He took to rebuilding Corvo Bianco with great zeal. He dedicated the most energy to planting a beautiful garden for his wife, thus starting the craze for the use of herbs which swept Toussaint at the time. After his wife, Bolius’ second love was the olive tree, which is why he planted a great many of them all over Corvo Bianco.<br><br>When Bolius’ wife died, life lost its savor for him and he began to think constantly about death. He sold his estate to Count Crespi, and the very day he signed the last piece of paperwork, he died.

By the power of said decree, each knight thus rendering aid will be rewarded according as per the following: a remuneration of the “Heron” type (in the case of aid in a battle against one human opponent) or of the “Crane” type (in the case of aid in a battle against more than one human opponent or a nonhuman opponent), to be paid from the funds of the knight receiving aid within one fiscal month.<br>Above-mentioned “Crane”-type remuneration has been awarded to the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who lent assistance to Sir X (the chivalric vows guarantee certain safeguards of personal privacy). Sir X was traversing the ruins near Mont Crane castle (in the Champs-Désolés) for purposes to be left unnamed (to further safeguard his identity) when he was attacked by members of the criminal organization led by Filibert von Wittan, alias Fourfingers. The group was dispersed and its members liquidated, pursuant to Her Illustrious Grace’s Order of March 24th, 1264, on the Protection of the Borderlands.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 15% to take into account the tax on assistance rendered while under the influence of toxic substances and immediate payment in species.

Heedless to our warnings that this contradicted the item‘s intended use and might lead to unpredictable side effects, it then fled towards the Sansretour River.

   1209237|394b22ea||Few know that sound is in fact not just a noise, but a wave - just like the waves of a sea striking against the shore. And just like them, sound waves strike everything in their path, which causes them to break. This particular property of sound is used by some species of animals and monsters as they carry out a kind of terrain mapping using their sense of hearing. Bats, which produce a specific sound to conduct echolocation based on how this sound's waves bounce off potential obstacles, make for a good example of this. Curiously, shaelmaars – mighty, though completely blind monsters – have developed a similar mechanism. They are able to locate their opponents by sensing the vibration of even the faintest sound wave.

His Grace the Duke couldn't believe his ears when I told him what had happened. Syanna got the whole blame and was suitably punished. Anarietta then tried to ease the situation, but the Duke and Duchess were resolute.<br><br>-III-<br><br>Today for the first time I accompanied the girls to the Land of a Thousand Fables, where we spent half a day. First we played with Thumbelina and then with Redbeard, who was extremely gallant for a highwayman. I am thoroughly impressed by what the master Artorius Vigo has achieved.

The girls said that if I wish to go there by myself, all I have to do is open the book Land of a Thousand Fables and say out loud the spell: Expecto ludum!<br><br>-IV-<br><br>Today, Syanna was tested by the mages sent by the Chapter.

   1206374|3bd88c84||There were many brave and true knights in the service of the old duke, but the greatest of them all was Luis Alberni. His crest showed a red field with a golden star, each of whose five points stood for one of the chivalric virtues.<br><br>Yet fame and glory went to Alberni’s head. Years passed and he began to think himself the most perfect of all knights. In the end, he came to think he was virtue incarnate and there was no one in the world who preceded him in this regard, something even the Lady of the Lake must recognize. Alberni thus set off to see her and have her pay him homage in honor of his excellency.<br><br>Yet as Alberni approached the Lady’s home, his body and equipment began to change. The slender knight grew more and more corpulent, until his horse could finally no longer bear him. His sword first became wooden, then turned into a mace, and his shining armor became dull and turned to ash. All he had left was his helmet, which turned into a wooden cage.<br><br>Alberni stood on the shore of the lake, wishing to speak, yet all that came from his lips was a wild cry. The knight peered at his reflection in the lake’s waters and understood he had become a giant. The Lady of the Lake then emerged and said: You abandoned the chivalric virtues long ago. Of all your sins, the greatest was pride. It has changed your sword into a mace, deprived you of armor and made your flesh into that of a beast. From now on you shall be known as Golyat. Go to Mount Gorgon, where you shall live in this form far from the eyes of men, accompanied by the painful memory of your lost glory, until the day death mercifully frees you from your torment.

They have a variety of origins and a variety of effects. It normally happens that a mage or sorceress casts a curse and the spell changes the subject. It doesn't always happen straight away. Sometimes, the person who has been cursed changes slowly bit by bit. It also happens that a normal fellow can cast a curse, someone whose conscience is clear and who has done good in their life. Such a person can acquire power and thus the aggrieved can place a curse on the evildoer. Such curses are strong and cannot be removed easily. Thus, everything by which human suffering is atoned is long lasting and painful.

Most recently they snatched up Gilbert, plucked him right off the wall. Gilbert was usually quite alert, but every man drops his guard a bit when emptying his water. Filibert’s furious. The cost of schooling a fresh-faced recruit into a functional member of our group is not inconsiderable. To have that cost turned into monster droppings – that’s regrettable waste.<br>Day Seven<br>We ambushed a caravan of merchants trekking from eastern Toussaint. They had no guards and put up no resistance, yet still we made virtually no profit – the shoddy rags they carried could only interest bare-bummed Skellige wildmen, and none of our group plans to voyage in that direction. Filibert grew furious yet again and killed one of the merchants, a man named Lumierex. The rest set off back east.<br>Day Eleven<br>Our scouts tracked down three men sneaking through the woods. They were all dressed as beggars and claimed to be such. We weren’t fooled. After a bit of rough play, they were revealed to be jewelers carrying gold from the mines of Maecht. Unrefined ore only, but of promising grade. Filibert ordered the jewelers killed. He hates liars with a passion.<br>Day Seventeen<br>An expedition from the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian’s pitched tent on the other side of the Sansretour. Scholars are not known to suffer from excess wealth, yet these have capacious tents and ample amounts of alcohol. Thus their fate was sealed. Filibert sent a few men their way.<br>Day Twenty-Three<br>It’s been almost two weeks since anything of interest came along the high road. Meanwhile, knights errant have caught more of our lads. Two died, one was merely wounded and escaped. We lost equipment worth a great many crowns. Filibert ordered the wounded man flogged for carelessness.

   1209053|3e6cfad9||I once quarreled with a man who insisted no substantial differences separate spriggans and leshens. The knave riled me greatly, for he had seen nearly nothing of life, yet spoke with the haughtiness of a witcher or other such professional for whom monsters are his stock and trade. One evening at the inn, his blather soured my beer such that I decided to prove to him a spriggan resembles a leshen only in the most superficial ways.<br><br>I thus took him deep into a wild wood and together we walked for upwards of two hours. I recalled having spied a spriggan there a year earlier and had heard the beasts are not fond of changing their place of dwelling. During my previous encounter, I had taken great fright at once and run off as fast as my legs would carry me. Later, I found out that, if undisturbed, a spriggan will rarely attack a human. Unfortunately, during my second encounter I learned the hard way that noise disturbs them. Greatly. When my acquaintance began engaging in loud mockery and cruel ribbing, chortling in raucous laughter all the while, a monster suddenly sprouted out of the ground before our very feet.<br><br>I could take no satisfaction in being proved correct, for the spriggan knocked my unfortunate fool of a colleague to the ground in one powerful blow and then trod him till his innards squirted out of every possible opening. I tried to escape, but it was as if my legs had planted roots in the ground. Meanwhile, the spriggan brought silence to the wood, shot me a stare and then sauntered off, as if nothing had happened.<br><br>That was, I pray, my last encounter with a spriggan and the last time I shall have to explain to anyone why those monsters are different from leshens.<br>

   1211199|3ec11d1a||The Belhaven school of drama, also known as the “school of the second entrance,” was defined by the director and playwright Severen Stallis. Stallis was a proponent of intensifying the dramatic action in the second act, during which the most characteristic aspect of his work would take place: the main character’s second entrance. During the second act, the play’s hero would also be forced to undergo a distinct transformation, one which would determine the fate he would meet in the third.<br>The Belhaven school stood in opposition to the Beauclair tradition of drama, where the second act rarely saw the principal characters through any serious transformations. Its role was rather to build tension en route to the grand finale taking place in the third act.

Said manor had previously been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of the brother-in-law of its current owners, a certain Monsieur Eduard de Mouton, his Crest a Fox Cub. Above-mentioned designation was based on reports of monstrous presences on the lands of said estate, inferred to be due to a lurking leshen.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster deemed a spriggan (W3 classification: relict.) The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 21% to take into account tribute exacted for the sustenance of mutilated veterans and payment made immediately in species.

Some fleders hunt alone, whereas others prefer to attack in groups. Perhaps it is a matter of instinct – having sensed blood, they assess the size of the victim and, if necessary, summon their kin. The only strong suit of these leeches is their ability to leap towards a potential victim.<br><br>Fighting a fleder is no different than fighting any other kind of bloodsucker. Apart from the obvious means, such as garlic, buckthorn, and sunlight, a hunter should stock up on silver. A lit torch may prove helpful as well.

The first mention of Wilhelm the Bold, this line’s founder, comes from elven manuscripts found during reconstruction of the Beauclair palace in 1095.

This line takes its name from Salvar the Lame, who was made a count in the year 1189 by Duchess Caroberta for his service to the ducal throne.

An ancient line whose founders most likely first settled the lands of present-day Toussaint around the year 984.

After weeks of analysis, consultations with specialists and trial runs on model doppelgangers, the Chief Royal Hairdresser, Master Hector, has decided to give Marziaola, the king’s current favorite, a… bob! Of course, Marzaiola, being a mere king’s mistress, cannot indulge in such extravagances as an asymmetric bob or an daringly shaved nape, therefore her bob is rather of the classically elegant sort, with a fringe that wonderfully complements the line of her eyes and covers her altogether unfortunate forehead.<br>Just as we speculated, the bob shall soon make a triumphant reentry as the absolute rage of the royal salon, and thanks to me, you, my dear friend, are now the first hairdresser of the South to know about it! I thus declare my mission accomplished and a stunning success! I’ll gather up my trappings and prepare to return. I hope you are ready for a long and eventful tête-à-tête once I arrive, and I hope that will be soon, for this seaside climate really does not suit me one bit, and this swill they call wine in Kovir is positively disgusting.<br><br>Warm Embraces,<br>Edgard Lavalliere

   1206237|440625ce||Est Est, often considered one of the chief treasures of the people of Toussaint, is the best known of the wines cultivated in that region. It is hard to determine when, exactly, the first barrels of Est Est were matured, though we can surmise it must have been around the time of the first human forays into the duchy’s present lands. What is certain is that this wine truly gained fame only during the reign of Duchess Adela Marta, who held Est Est in near divine esteem and for that reason bestowed upon Castel Ravello the privilege of being the official ducal vineyard. She also reserved a special place in the cellars of the Beauclair Palace for Est Est, and to this day two barrels of every vintage are ceremoniously deposited on those shelves. The tapping of any of them is, by order of the ducal edict “Vino Sanctus Est,” punishable by death through dragging behind a team of horses.

I must take all my most valuable possessions and hide them in the amphitheater. I shall now wear the key to my chest on my person at all times, hanging from this necklace the jeweler made for me… [rest of the page has disintegrated]<br><br>The 33rd Day of the Month of Lammas, Year 1178<br>It gets worse and worse... I fear she wishes to kill me! I feel an itch in my back – presaging her dagger?! Or perhaps this itch in my throat, is that her, as well?! Shall it be poison then?! Very theatrical of her, either way… Gods, I swear – if that despicable creature does anything to hurt me, I shall turn this amphitheater into an earthly hellscape!

   1208761|45fc611d||During a visit to the court of the king of Nazair, Waltharius the Brawny fell madly in love with the king's daughter, the beautiful Hiltgunt, who was already promised to a prince from Metinna. Waltharius, paying no heed to these politically-inspired marriage plans, captured the princess’ heart and together they ran off to Toussaint. The prince from Metinna, unable to let such an affront pass, followed the star-crossed lovers. Yet Waltharius was renowned for his courage and might and thus slew his adversary with ease. Then he and his beloved returned to his family estate at Dun Tynne.<br><br>To his dismay, it turned out his brother Vislavius had nearly led the estate to bankruptcy while Waltharius had been in Nazair. Waltharius threw his brother into the dungeon and, as befits a self-respecting nobleman, embarked on a knightly expedition. Unfortunately his young wife, Hiltgunt, tortured by her solitude, freed Vislavius and became his lover. When Waltharius returned and realized he had been cuckolded, he murdered them both in a fit of passion and despair. Then he sat down and wept and wept and wept…

   1152363|4665fe21||32 Feainn 1203<br>My road has reached its end. I, Merten, having been given as a child to members of the Manticore guild of witchers, having been subjected to their vile mutations and refashioned by their destructive regime of training, do this day cease to be a witcher. I have finished my pilgrimage and divested myself of all that tied me to my old life. I have journeyed to the Hidden Chapel in the Cave of Tribulations and survived. Today, I am born anew. Here, in the Lake of Cleansing, I leave behind the last of the items which signify my attachment to my previous incarnation as a witcher. Along with them I leave behind my cares, my grievances and my obligations. I cast off all that I was, including my name – from now on, I shall answer to Shavel. I am a new man. Thank you, Most Redoubtable Lebioda! <br><br>I feel my new self pushing me onward, to new lands and places which remain hidden from me. The good folk who helped me during my journey always said I must listen to my inner voice and follow it, for it is through that inner voice that Lebioda speaks to us. I shall not go against its will. I will set off, north, to Temeria, Aedirn, perhaps even the Dragon Mountains. I will proclaim the glory of Lebioda and do good deeds – just as the Prophet commanded.

They say if any lass finds the toad and kisses its froggy lips, it’ll turn from a slimy beast back into a handsome prince, and then it’s clear what’ll happen – prince like that’s no village lush, he's sure to be honorable and worthy, and’ll take whoever rescues him for his bride.<br><br>So Ronnie, next time you’re in Oxenfurt at market, take a stroll into the sewers, I’m telling you.

Very little of note has happened here since you left. Despite your warnings, we get on well with the humans. They are so fascinating in the way they obsess over death... Caoilfhionn, if you can imagine it, admitted to Bláthnaid she really likes Arnaud, the miller’s son. Personally, I’ve nothing against this, but I know where you are – in Dol Blathanna – that would be unthinkable.<br>I went to visit Maolsheachlann’s grave recently… Yes, I know you won’t approve of that. Since when do the Aen Seidhe care for the graves of their loved ones? Yet living among people necessarily means we take on some of their customs. While there, I happened to learn the humans plan to build a village near Crevan Carn. This is difficult, for personally it does not bother me, but Bláthnaid – you know her – began screaming about how this was a profanation and they have countless other perfectly good spots where they could build their village. I hope this will not grow into some larger conflict, we have it so good here… [rest of the letter is illegible]

If you could see her little face when rays of sunlight hit it... Pure joy. She looks just like she was before the accident. If it gets a bit warmer, I will have her chair taken to the garden.<br><br>The day before yesterday, Master Buyvarde's wife, Elisa, visited us. You remember her don't you? When the Buyvarde's moved to Kovir, all the society ladies were scared of inviting her to dine as she seemed to be either mad or some sort of self-taught witch. This was all because, despite not having the right education, she made magic ointments and cosmetics. It is said that she spent three years in the Dragon Mountains learning from some elven sorceress... <br><br> You know I don't pay much heed to gossip, which is why when the butler announced her, I immediately invited her in for a glass of lemonade. It turns out that she is an exceedingly charming person, and stories of her alleged witchcraft are highly exaggerated -- she actually studied for three years at Aretuza, but because of some bad investments made by her father she had to leave the academy. She left, however, with a good knowledge of plants and their magical applications. She brought with her a healing ointment which I have to rub into Clarissa's legs each morning and evening for ten days. When the treatment is complete, Elisa promises to visit us again to see the results and advise us further. I have a good feeling about this woman. In my next letter, I'll tell you what happened with the treatment she recommended.<br><br>Take care of yourself my dearest. I beg that you don't overreact and do something silly, if something happened to you I wouldn't know what to do.<br><br>I love you,<br>Arabella

   1205854|4e4c63fd||Toussaint can boast many world-famous vineyards, such as Castel Ravello, Pomerol, Vermentino and Tufo. Their owners take great care to maintain the time-tested traditions and heirloom recipes on which the reputation of the wines they produce rests.  But Toussaint is also home to numerous smaller vineyards which do not even possess their own crests and whose wines have yet to win any particular renown, making it difficult to say much about them. Hortense is just such a place.

   1209223|4ffd7d0a||If you take a fleder and magnify all of its most primitive traits, you will get a protofleder. This beast, the fleder's distant ancestor, arrived here from a parallel sphere centuries past, yet, unlike the fleder, has remained untouched by any post-Conjunction evolutionary processes. In our time protofleders are extremely rare, the more suitably adapted fleders having taken over their niche in our biosphere.<br><br> Protofleders are thus lesser vampires. Their massive, wide jaws constitute their main weapons, their sharp claws coming in a close second.<br><br>Similarly to their more developed cousins, protofleders rely on their instincts rather than intelligence and are quite sensitive to the scent of blood. All the usual means of fighting vampires, such as vampire oil, Black Blood, and silver weapons, apply to them as well.

All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…<br><br>Well, we're botched.

It is mainly grown for its olives, which are pressed for their oil, but is also prized among woodcarvers. The unquestionably most cherished tree in the region, however, is the Beauclair oak, which is used in the making of wine barrels. And the most important place in Toussaint for the processing of this tree is the Rioux-Cannes woodcutters' outpost.

Whole hanse had been fixing for ages to make a jaunt over to that tavern. For how long can you sit twiddling your thumbs at a place as foul as the ruins of Arthach? Water up to our ankles, fungus everywhere and the wind blowing so fierce our bums pucker. Why the dead-dong-diddle stick around? So we didn’t! We got our doodoo together and went to work! Hit them so hard, before they figured out what was going on, half of them had already been hacked apart! It was over in a flash. In fact, we got so carried away, not a living soul was to be seen when we were through, though it seems a few managed to scatter into the woods, including that blasted Nilfgaardian owner, but we’ll see to tracking down survivors later. Meanwhile, we’ll drink a bit, sing a bit, and then head out for a good hunt… So, there you go, my memoirs, signed me, vice-head of the hanse, Speedy Eugene.

The processes also deprive witchers of emotions and human reflexes.<br><br>Although information about the Trial of the Grasses and other transformations to which young adepts of the witcher craft are subjected is strictly protected by master witchers and witcher sorcerers, Ludovic Cèlestin of Ban Ard claims the albumen of gray scolopendromorphs, the strain of giant centipede more commonly known as Pale Widows, constituted the basis of witcher mutagens.

In that capacity I turn to you for help, for you are both the best rhabdomancer in all the duchy and also a dear friend, so I pray you will not refuse me your services. Curious how your services might be needed by me in managing my vineyard? I shall soon tell you.<br><br>Before his death, Count Crespi ordered an extraordinary valuable batch of seedlings and if we do not plant them in the very near future, they shall all wither and perish. Sadly, the count left no record of where in the estate we are to prepare the ground for these seedlings. The geologist whom the count had summoned to show us the most fitting soil collected his (hefty) retainer, then disappeared. I would not be surprised to learn he was a common cheat. But let us get to the heart of the matter. I wish to ask you to use your rhabdomancical talents to locate where we should plant these valuable vines. I dare trust you shall take pity on an old friend and see to the task right away. Belgaard’s coffers are, it is true, empty, but I think I shall find a way to compensate you for your troubles.<br><br>Your Friend, Thierry Pires,<br><br>P.S. Be careful, for ever since Count Crespi’s death, this area has not been as safe as it once was.

   1139591|58f7d13f||The elves are fond of saying, "We do not fear the well-known." Thus wild boars, being similar in appearance to domestic swine (Sus scrofa domesticus), are at times dismissed as harmless. For why should one cower before a furry pig when wyverns and manticores prowl the land?<br><br>The boar's appearances, however, are deceiving. Wild boars breathe no fire and carry no venom, true, but they have ushered many a hunter into the next life all the same. So that you may not share their fate, dear reader, read close the following.<br><br>Wild boars live in groups, called packs, of three to five individuals each. When aggravated, they will begin to circle their aggressor until, the moment being ripe, they charge. Wild boars then strike with heads as hard as battering rams and puncture with tusks aimed for the stomach or crotch.<br><br>Some try to slay the boar by approaching it from the rear, but I do not recommend this method: the beast will in such a case strike out its hind legs with such cruel force as to crush bone into dust. Better first to slow the boar with a trap, or, if one is learned in such rites, with a spell, and then try to fight using the power of the elements – for the beasts are particularly vulnerable to fire.

Naturally, by "the entire world," I in fact mean the areas that have entered man’s jurisdiction – Toussaint’s architecture obviously could not hold a candle to the wonders of Dol Blathanna. That is in no way meant to detract from the glory of the ruins of Termes, the old amphitheater or Arthach, the one-time summer residence to Toussaint's kings. More than any of these, however, it is the palace which captures one’s eye with its… [torn page]<br><br>…spacious terraces seemingly enclosed by openwork exedras with rows of intricate tracery and pinnacles crowned with spiked crockets. One may admire them through legions of ogival windows, the traceries of which are often decorated with the floral ornaments so typical for the culture of the Aen Seidhe. This style is especially prominent in its buttresses and niches.

Each splash against the stone is like a pounding on the doors of my head. I know I cannot keep them behind those doors for long. They know that as well. Soon I will once again hear their mocking laughter, their ridicule.<br><br>The spoon shall come in handy – I have rubbed my hand along its handle so long, it feels a part of my flesh. Now I shall bar shut the doors to my head once and for all.

Start the morning with baguette and camembert, then shuffle some parchments and head for home before dusk. Today, however, the normal order of things was disturbed – dramatically. I came across a highly interesting note in the archives. And, along with it, a key. The key is the more interesting find, because according to what I could decipher from the dust-covered scribblings on the note, it opens a chest full of gold coins! But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br><br>While doing some routine straightening of the files, I found a report outlining procedures for the reform of Bastoy Prison – orders straight from Duke Henri Gras. We all are aware how badly this experiment ended, for the ruins of that prison to this day frighten any potential “tourists” with their battered skeletons and legends about howling spirits of the murdered guards. Yet I did not know that hiding among the abandoned ruins there was a chest, and that its key was lying right under my nose! The chest supposedly contains crowns meant for the purchase of books and rations for the inmates of Bastoy. One of the clerks employed here at the time committed a sin of omission and sent the chest to the warden without the key. Yet perhaps that was for the best? The warden was impaled and the guards all skinned alive, meaning those degenerates would have also got their hands on the chest, had he received the key. As it is – might the chest still be there, unopened?<br><br>Folk say a curse has fallen on that place, a dark power brought down by the bestiality of the murders it beheld, but folk also say an Ofieri will become emperor of Nilfgaard and herald the end of the world, so there’s not much point giving any of such jabbering much credence.

They do not like that I speak the truth about their former deities. They cannot understand they will only find salvation in Lebioda. They threaten me with death, but if I am to die for Lebioda, if that is the destiny the Prophet has marked out for me, I shall fulfill it with a broad smile on my face.<br><br>14 Feainn 1203<br>I have just parted with a most marvelous guest, a true convert, a man of extraordinary yearning for truth and faith. He is called Merten and was once a witcher but has abandoned that dishonorable trade and embarked on the path of truth. We spoke at length and sat together for hours in meditation and prayer. To better honor Lebioda he left behind here many goods which symbolized his attachment to his former life. He has made great progress – oh, If only all the disciples of Lebioda were so fervent in their faith, this world would be a better place!<br><br>Merten confessed to me the bitter truth about the foul deeds he had wrought in his past life. I told him if he is to obtain cleansing, he must go to the Hidden Chapel. Reaching this bleak place, which is carved out of rock and ridden with dangerous creatures, will in itself constitute a challenge and a trial – if Lebioda lets him enter the chapel’s confines, it means he has forgiven his sins, his crimes. And so Merten went… Let Lebioda guide his feet.<br><br>19 Feainn 1203<br>My fate is sealed. I shall die for my faith, for truth, for Lebioda. This night folk from the village, a band of drunken thugs, attacked the temple. With hate and malice on their breath they cried that since I am the Great Beggar, I should now beg Lebioda for mercy. They looted the temple of all its treasures (thankfully leaving the books, which they deemed worthless) and walled me in to wither in a sealed tomb... If Lebioda does not send me help, I will die here. May my bones bear witness to his glory.

   1206322|60cff59d||Gwent: for many a diverting game of cards, for others, a noble pursuit, for some – a crippling addiction which devours their every coin and every waking moment. These last can be found most frequently among the dwarves, the game’s inventors and most passionate devotees. Their devotion extends to gwent’s paraphernalia, its cards most of all, which they craft with great care and skill - in fact, cards painted by dwarven masters are often considered miniature works of art. In past times they devoted equal attention to whittling the clubs which contestants once kept at their sides, to bash each other about the head with in the case of an argument. As brawls grew less common, the clubs became implied threats more than used weapons, until eventually falling into disuse and near oblivion.<br><br>Today gwent players can be found almost everywhere, from the Skellige Isles (where the game was introduced by the druid Ermion) to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.<br><br>In gwent, the play of cards mimics the dueling of two armies. The playing field is divided into two parts, each split into three rows. Nearest to the center stand units who fight at close quarters, behind them, archers and other such ranged attackers, and furthest back, machines and creatures used for siege purposes. Both players wield decks made up of a minimum of 22 unit cards and a maximum of 10 special cards, and each must also contain a leader card. The player who wins the toss of a coin (originally: the dwarf whose wife has the longest beard) plays first. Each player draws at random 10 cards from his deck and then is allowed to redraw 2 of these before the laying of cards begins. Each round is won by the player who has played cards of the greatest value. The first to achieve 2 victorious rounds wins, meaning a maximum of 3 rounds are played. The winner’s prize is agreed upon by the players before each match – most often, the wager is a bounty of coin or a rare card<br><br>The heart of the players’ armies, the unit cards, come in three types:<br>close combat units,<br>ranged combat units,<br>siege units.<br><br>Each such card is assigned a strength rating and may additionally possess special abilities.<br><br>There are also special cards which have no strength rating but instead influence the course of the game in other ways.<br><br>Unit cards depicting famed heroes not only have unusually high strength ratings, but also have the added benefit of ignoring the workings of all special cards. These are the rarest and most coveted of gwent cards. Most frequently they must be won from top players or purchased at a great price from collectors. <br><br>The cards in classic gwent are divided into four factions:<br>The Northern Realms, leader: Foltest<br>The Nilfgaardian Empire, leader: Emhyr var Emreis <br>Monsters, leader: Eredin Bréacc Glas<br>The Scoia'tael, leader: Francesca Findabair.

This might be the breakthrough I needed in my work on the teleport. For my trial run, I have calibrated the portal to exit in the cave near the tower's base. I need now only charge the crystal with solar energy, for which purpose I have placed it in the outer wall of the tower, near the scaffolding. Only hours remain before it is entirely charged!<br><br>I have finished my work on a diagram which will allow us to replicate this armor and equip the entire School of the Wolf with it. Varin, the witchers' fencing instructor, has taken credit for this find, but it was I who, using logical deduction and only a slight dollop of magic assistance, uncovered the chamber where Elgar must have once resided. The space was hidden behind a primitive illusion, one needed merely look carefully to see through it. I found notes which indicate Elgar had worked out diagrams for improvements to his equipment which he then hid for safekeeping in various locations around the world. Careful study of his notes allowed me to write up instructions on how to find these upgrades. I went to the old watchtower and gave this research to Chird. As soon as he finishes preparing the silver sword diagram, he will set out to gather all the upgrade diagrams. Varin has the finished steel sword diagram and will begin forging blades based on it. I hope he will distribute them to the poor lads he trains - they at least deserve proper equipment after going through the horror he calls training.<br><br>By the gods - I think I see fire on the horizon, coming from where the old watchtower stands!

Sadly, he did not fulfill his oath and instead plummeted to his doom after a few paces. Cunigunde, his beautiful daughter, swore that day she would only marry the man who could finish her father’s deed. Many a stripling lad lost his life attempting to fulfill that comely maid’s cruel condition. When finally one succeeded, he surveyed the carnage she had wrought and decided she was unworthy of his affections. Realizing with despair how despicably she had acted, Cunigunde threw herself from the castle walls, dying smashed against the rocks below like so many of her unfortunate suitors.

It’s even better than at home, for at home there rarely was anything to eat and when mummy died, there was never anything at all.<br><br>Today I played with Miri and Tomm – first we played Duck, duck, goose, then hide and seek, then pick-a-stick. Then we played tag. I had a lot of fun! Then a cart from Lady Orianna came and there was lots of food. There were sweet rolls, fruit and cake, and many other tasty things. Lady Orianna is the best!<br><br>Lady Orianna visited us early in the morning. First she talked with us, then she sang to us, and then she took Johnny to the other room. We were all jealous of him. When he came back, he was a little pale and had small red marks on his neck, but he also had a huuuge bag of chocolates! Miri says sometimes Lady Orianna takes a child and does something to them, I didn’t really understand what, but then they get a gift from her. I hope next time she takes me!<br><br>Today’s rainy and I’m really bored. Tomm said I’m stupid, but I don’t believe him because he's stupid, too. Maybe Lady Orianna will come tomorrow and I’ll get a gift from her. That will show him!<br><br>She chose me! Lady Orianna came and chose me! I went to the other room with her, she told me to show her my neck, and then she kind of bit me. It didn’t really hurt, I just felt dizzy later. But that’s not important because she gave me a wooden sword! Nobody has one like that! Tomm will be so jealous!

   1208765|692756d4||…For those who find the wines of the Sansretour Valley too dull, I strongly recommend the lesser-known but still outstanding brands produced in the Blessure Valley. Let us start with the amazing Côte-de-Blessure, produced at the Pomerol vineyard. I particularly recommend the 1260-1263 vintages, with their distinctively rich flavor. Looking elsewhere, the nearby Zurbarrán castle offers the dry Castel de Neuf, whereas Nuragus and Sancerre, located in the northern parts of Toussaint, specialize in red wines and, jointly, produce and export the wine known in the North as Toussaint Red. Exquisite rosé wine could once be found at Casteldaccia, but ever since its owner tragically passed away, the vineyard has fallen into decay…

Those wines, why, don’t get me started on Est Est - ever since they started mass-producing it, they should call it Était Était, for it's definitely seen better days.” Then he says, “Right you are, always been a Côte-de-Blessure chap myself. In fact, between you and me, I even prefer it to Sangreal” -  you know, the wine reserved for Her Illustrious Highness and her inner circle.<br><br>And then, the fool I am, I blurt out, “Oh, I agree, whenever Her Grace has me taste it, I’ve got to swill my mouth out with vodka afterwards, to wash out that rancid taste.” Oh, come on, I was drunk, wasn’t I? Talking out of my bum. Well, turns out I had rather overvalued my position at court. Tremblay needed but say a word in the duchess' ear and, in three shakes of a donkey's tail, I was out on the street. The job of ducal taster’s been given back to Benoit – can you believe it?

To win the approval of his future father-in-law, Gareth had to perform seven challenges.[...]<br><br>The seventh was the hardest. Gareth had to go to Lynx Crag, find the witch who lives there and convince her to lift the drought that plagued the whole land.

You see, the witch from Lynx Crag was spiteful and headstrong, even for a witch, and only an act of true humility could break her icy heart.<br><br>Gareth, however, had no intention of bending his knee before a witch. Instead, he planned to force her to lift the curse. Nobody knows what happened on Lynx Crag, but Gareth never returned to his beloved. Daphne stood on the top of a hill and looked for him day and night. Finally, she turned into a tree, so that she may live to see the return of her knight. Such was the strength of her longing and the power of her love.<br><br>Anyone who plunged his axe blade into that tree would see blood run from the wound.

   1130662|6be1ba35||[Last pages torn from Count Romilly's journal]<br><br>A pox upon Anastasia von Bourmann, a pox upon her whole ploughing house! I’ve finally found a way to end this deadly little charade she’s put on. The key to unraveling the riddle lay in a dusty old tome in my library. That little vipress was marked by a leshen! That is why the monster attacked my castle. There was only one way out of this situation…<br><br>I snuck up while she slept and throttled her. She didn't even manage to peep. Now I can finally leave my castle walls, thank the gods. The monstrosity has skirted off into oblivion along with that accursed child. That entire affair was a horrific error. I’m just glad the savings from previous missions are safely preserved in the castle treasury. I must recruit some mage, perhaps that will ensure I avoid such incidents in the future.

   1135722|6f1db9a4||The essence of Evil is to cause suffering. There exist many varieties of suffering: from common corporeal pain through the rarefied torment of the psyche to deep wounds dealt to the soul. Whence then does Evil arise? Does it appear on its own? Or does it only spread when conditions are ripe? And finally, the most important question: How can Evil be defeated?<br><br>Most believe Evil has always existed, for none remember a time when it did not. Yet is that sufficient proof? I dare to doubt it, for I am a scholar, and the essence of scholarship is to question all hypotheses until they have been rigorously proven.<br><br>The appearance of Evil is closely tied to the existence of Good, its opposite and antithesis. Good without evil is dimensionless and therefore imperceptible. Evil, then, is an integral part of our lives.<br><br>Evil wears many faces and appears in many different forms. One of them wears a skin of flesh. This Evil incarnated as man travels the world, sowing death and suffering. Such Evil is devious and difficult to discern. We usually only note its presence when it is already too late.<br><br>In my scholarly wanderings through the myths and legends of a great many cultures, I’ve come across descriptions of a certain individual which all display a striking similarity. I do not mean in terms of this individual’s outer appearance or name, but of his modus operandi. This Evil works through trickery, tempting at first with the offer of something seemingly good. The price one must pay for this object of temptation, however, is enormous and nonrefundable, and the promised good often contains horrifying hooks and treacherous traps. Beware, then, of any who promise the impossible, for such can only be delivered through the machinations of Evil.

   1208923|700275b1||Once upon a time, in a small mound near the Vermentino vineyard, there lived a wight named Franconi. Amiable by nature, he spent his days in the mound, cooking various kinds of soups. Not that he was particularly fond of soups – it was his beloved pet, a barghest named Spikey, that slurped them up greedily. And so they sat there, side by side, Franconi the Wight and Spikey the Barghest, cooking soups made of decaying bones, withered weeds and, if they managed to swipe some metal, nails, their favorite delicacy.<br><br>One day Franconi heard two gravediggers talk about a certain man of wealth who kept various kinds of cheese in his cellar. A cheese soup sounded like a delectable treat to Franconi, so he snuck into the noble’s cellar and stole the biggest cheese wheel there was. When he got home, Franconi started slowly melting the cheese in his favorite pot. The stench was so awful Spikey ran off and refused to go back to the mound. To add to the already terrible state of things, the smell of cheese permeated everything, so Spikey and Franconi had to pack their things and move.<br><br>The moral of the story is simple. If you are cooking a cheese soup, make sure the cheese you choose is not blue.

   1205905|70b26368||Once upon a time, a plague of frogs visited the Sansretour Marsh. Duchess Ademarta declared a prize would be given to whomever freed the land of these accursed amphibians. Yet neither the knights errant nor the druids nor anyone else proved up to the task – until a poor raftsman named Flovive figured out a way. He serenaded the frogs with his violin and they, entranced by his melody, followed him out of the duchy. In memory of this event, the settlement where Toussaint’s raftsmen dwell bears his name.

   1206344|70fcbc07||The last day of the tourney had come and it was now clear Gottfried would tilt against the mysterious Chessboard Knight in the joust. Gottfried was the ducal champion at the time, so all were counting on his victory. No one knew a thing about the Chessboard Knight except that he had come from the south in dark armor and had a shield bearing  sixty-four black-and-white squares.<br><br>When the herald trumpeted the signal, the knights charged at each other. Gottfried’s lance shattered against the Chessboard Knight’s shield and the mysterious knight swayed in his saddle. No mere mortal could have survived such a blow, yet the Chessboard Knight did not fall from his horse, but instead struck a blow of his own on the next pass, knocking Gottfried to the ground.<br><br>The victor approached his defeated foe, stuck out his hand and helped him stand. Before the herald could announce his victory, he took off his helm and all beheld his eyes of coal and face of burnt cinders.<br><br>”I have come from a time long passed to remind you of humility, which is a long-forgotten virtue. My name was consumed by dragon fire when I perished, victim of my own pride.”<br><br>After saying these words the Chessboard Knight rode off. No one stopped him, yet they repeat his warning to this day.

They flooded a great number of villages, private estates and even Arthach, an elven summer palace. These experiments were what gave the Sansretour Marsh its current shape and put half of Crane Isle permanently underwater. They also created an unpleasant bog to the north of the city where none can tread in true safety.

They say if you cannot find what you seek at Beauclair’s market, it doesn’t exist. In addition to wine of every label and vintage, here one can buy slate from Ardaiso, fleece from Toussaint merinos raised at Basane or olive oil from the groves of Dun Tynne.
   1208408|72e0c1e3||Ra'mses Gor-Thon's recipe for “étoile blanche” pasta<br><br>Ingredients:<br><br>1 hearty scoop of thick yogurt (preferably Gemmeran style)<br>1 handful of chanterelles<br>1 glass of red wine, semi-dry<br>1 turkey breast <br>tagliatelle pasta, to taste<br>6 cherry tomatoes<br>1 bunch of arugula<br>1 Zerrikanian bouquet garni (the kind with exotic herbs and spices)<br>Dun Tynne olive oil<br>1 small bowl of ricotta<br>salt and pepper<br>2 cloves of garlic<br><br>Rub the turkey breast with salt, then immerse in a marinade made of the yogurt, Zerrikanian bouquet and crushed garlic. Leave in a cool place for at least two hours. Boil the chanterelles till they are soft, but don’t make jam out of them – remember, al dente, you fool! Prepare the tagliatelle in the same way. If you make mush here, you might as well hang up your apron, for you’re no chef. Once the turkey’s taken on the bouquet’s fragrance, throw it in a pan with the heated olive oil. Pour in the wine – once it’s boiled off, toss in the pasta. Let it fry for a bit. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the noodles. Give it all a good peppering. Add two tablespoons of ricotta – mix thoroughly. Plate the dish and decorate with the arugula.

   1122936|7406f1b2||I’ve naught left. Not a blooming thing. All I can do now's pass on my family's tale of horror and woe, then pass on myself, soon as I’ve written it all up in this letter.<br><br>Seems a faded dream now, but there were a time when we were happy. My beautiful wife, Ornesta, and myself.  We were married in high style, with a fitting feast, then a year later our dear Mildburga was born. Folk praised the wean’s beauty, said she were the spitting image of her mum. Ornesta’d get all cross when they talked like that, but I paid it no heed at the time. Soon enough our family grew. First Matilda, then Ethel came into the world, both fair as angels. But Ornesta… well, I’ll never forget the eve she sat there, combing her long, chestnut hair while the girls cried and cried. I said to her, “Love, I reckon the lasses’re hungry.” That’s when she lashed out at me for the first time. Said they'd no right to be hungry – they’d stolen her beauty and her youth, that should be more than enough to feed on…<br><br>I should’ve known it then. I should’ve guessed madness had burrowed into my love’s head, and every compliment paid to her lasses' beauty made it burrow ever deeper. Year by year, the young'un's grew taller and more lovely. But time’s not so kind to the old, and Ornesta weren't spared its cruelty, which took her skin’s spring and its sheen of youth.<br><br>One night I was awoken by a startling moon which lit all the world in an eerie glow. I looked around the hut, and saw it was empty. I ran out the door and followed a set of bare footprints, leading to the cemetery by the chapel. Seeing that, my heart jumped up into my throat…<br><br>I found them, all three, lying around the fountain. Were I not been their father, I’d never have recognized them. Deep gashes mutilated their fair faces. Strips of skin and hunks of flesh were strewn all about… As I stood beholding this butchery, I had the feeling someone was watching me. And I weren't mistaken. Ornesta stood there on a stool by a lone tree. She had a rope draped ‘round her neck like some demonic necklace. “They took it from me, all of it, all I had, all I cherished,” she said. Then she jumped.<br><br>She’s dead. My Ornesta. My three daughters – dead as well. I’ll soon join them. I’ve taken all I have and gave it to the gods, perhaps they’ll forgive me and my beloved Ornesta…

   1206332|769b5e1b||Dear Pafnuzio,<br><br>As answer to your letter, I shall try to draw up from the recesses of my memory what I know about the first attempts to raise a statue to Lebioda in Toussaint.<br>It was, if my mind serves me, over half a century ago, during the reign of Anna Henrietta's grandmother, Duchess Carolina Roberta. The cult of Lebioda, popular in the North… [illegible fragment]<br>The cult was flourishing in Toussaint at that time due to the deeds of a supposed disciple of Lebioda - Plegmund. I say "supposed" because no one ever… [illegible fragment]<br>The miracles that Plegmund worked in those days were on everyone’s lips. Even one of my… [illegible fragment]<br>For Plegmund, though, the beautiful temple built according to his designs in the south of the city was not enough. He was out for something larger - literally! He managed to persuade the duchess that the most magnificent symbol of good people of Toussaint’s faith would be a statue... [illegible fragment]<br>Soon after work started at Ardaiso, whose foreman I was at the time, as you know, it emerged that Plegmund was a fraud. He was no miracle worker, but rather miracle swindler, who… [illegible section]<br>And then he disappeared into thin air, along with most of the coin gathered to build the statue. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that ever since the people of Toussaint have been rather skeptical about [illegible fragment]<br><br>Paul Francisque

   1139594|776ddc93||Ever since arachnomorphs – commonly known as pitchfiends or knotlegs – first wandered from the east and into the lands of the Northern Realms, much has been said and written about them, and much of this has been none too wise. Bits of this passed-down knowledge have contained a few grains of truth, others, but distant echoes, while others still were clearly pulled out of some pseudo-scholar’s rear end. I therefore feel it my duty, as the most eminent expert on insectoids north of the Yaruga, to separate the truth from the lies, like grain from so much chaff, and share the results with the people.<br><br>Let us begin with the basics. Arachnomorphs are unusually swift, even for arachnids. It is difficult to flee them, on horseback as well as afoot. Even if one does outpace them at first, his rescue is but temporary, for they are able to spew webs from great distance which entangle their victim’s legs in a flash. Larger individuals, mistakenly considered a separate species by some, are in addition especially skillful jumpers.<br><br>The best slayers of arachnomorphs are witchers: by using well-chosen oils and Signs, such as Aard, Yrden or Axii, they are able to face and defeat these creatures. That provides but little comfort to the rest of us, however, for there are fewer and fewer of these monster slayers by the year, while the monsters themselves grow ever greater in number.

As you know, my affections for you are powerful beyond all measure, and I yearn for you to become my husband with all my being. Soon we shall stand together at the marital altar, but I hope you understand this must be a ceremony to make the duquessa herself green with envy! Do not think this an admonishment in any way, my dear, but we both know your modest soldier’s wage will not allow us to put on the extravagant ball which we both deserve. But do not be sad! I have found a solution to our little problem!<br><br>You surely know about the shipwreck on the bottom of the Sansretour, but I doubt you know the full history of how it came to be there. Back in the time of Duke Raymund, one of the wealthiest men in the duchy, Gaël Sasque, decided to hold a ball in the middle of the river. And what a ball it was… Beautifully coiffed grandes dames, elegant gentlemen in white shirts and striking doublets… Gaël apparently took a crate of jewelry aboard and changed rings multiple times to impress all with his wealth. The event was in full swing when, suddenly, a violent storm rolled in. The wind snapped the masts and capsized the vessel. All the wealthy guests, draped in gold and jewels, sank to the bottom in a flash! This tragic story might yet have a happy ending, however, for I have obtained the key to Gaël Sasque's chest!<br><br>I imagine you know see why our future prosperity is within easy reach. After all, the drowned dead do not need diamonds, am I not right?<br><br>Loving You More Than Life Itself,<br><br>Bella de Gunness

Rage burns my entrails. Writing this is the only way I know to calm the flames.<br><br>When I am an old man and read these notes, I believe a certain Maximus Nonius Macrinus will be long dead. A pitiful memory. For now, however, he lives. Why do I write about this? A few days ago I challenged him to a duel. To the death. He had been drooling over my Lucienne and I could not bear it. He proved to be a better swordsman than I. But that is not the worst. A lost finger is nothing compared to lost honor. Maximus defeated me, yet instead of killing me, he spared my life. Never shall I forget the faces of the men who turned their eyes from me then.<br>I know I shall never know peace until I have dealt with him.<br><br>[a dozen or so blank pages]<br><br>I have found the journal which I was given by my father several years ago. During the time since I last held it, much has occurred in my life. I have fled Toussaint and sought my fortune in various places. With varied success. The worst, however, is that my hand has yet to grasp Maximus’ throat. I know it is only a matter of time.<br><br>I have decided to return to that hound-botched duchy. We have pitched camp on Mont Crane. I’ve carefully selected a band of men who will not flee from any task, any foe. The Toussaint which once forced me to run will now repay me in full. The highest price, however, shall be paid by Maximus Nonius Macrinus. When I get my hands on him, he will dream of one thing: death.<br>I’ve got the harlotsbrood! He’s lording it up at the Casteldaccia estate. He was given it by that sodden tart Anarietta – seems Duke Raymund’s been dead for a few years. Tomorrow my lads will pay him a visit. I shan’t go with them, however. The very thought of having to see his maggoty face again makes me ill. Farewell, Maximus, I have signed your death warrant.<br><br>I’m delighted. Maximus and all his family now rot. Their stench is a delight to stray mutts. Whenever I close my eyes, I see them perish. See them scream, moan and grovel. That makes my dinger stand firmer than even the curviest harlot could. I am at last satisfied.<br>

They resemble women or nymphs, so they can blend into the crowd unnoticeably, even though in truth they are bloodsuckers – ruthless vampires savoring human blood, for whom man is nothing but a toy. There is no beast more dreadful than one that can disguise as one of us - a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But there is another reason why bruxae chill our blood - this female creature kindles man's hidden fear of sexuality and of being dominated by a woman.

Naturally he demanded a fortune for his services, but I am ready to do anything to get myself out of the duchess’ black books. The witcher collected a down payment and set off for the Amell Mountains...<br><br>I’ve got it! Success! With an offering for Her Grace worthy of an emperor, I can at last return to the duchy and seek forgiveness! Now I need only find a way to transport the shaelmaar to Beauclair...<br><br>I gathered my entire retinue and together we embarked on the good ship Suzanne. With the current in our favor, we should be in the capital in a mere three days!<br><br>I feel like the hero of some elven tragedy. Just when it seems all is going perfectly, catastrophes fall from the sky and pummel me to the ground… The shaelmaar chewed through the deck, sank the ship and dug its way into the river bottom. I begged the captain to help me capture the monster in exchange for the rest of my fortune. As the witcher instructed, I will light incense made of rue and direct the smoke at the monster, which should calm it. The sailors can then capture it in their nets.<br><br>I am finished. The rue incense did not work. The shaelmaar flew into a rage and killed nearly everyone. True, the captain managed to escape, but I could see he was badly wounded, so I doubt he managed to swim out of that cavern. Now I sit here alone, listening to the shaelmaar devour the remains of the murdered sailors.<br><br>You! The person who has found my journal, whoever you may be! Take the rest of my fortune – for what good is a chest of jewels to a pile of moldy bones? But in exchange, please, drink to my health, to my sad fate, to the hero of a true elven tragedy.

Most afflicted with lycanthropy are not in complete control of their transformations. Once in wolven form, they are driven purely by a strong predatory instinct and a hunger which they seek to satiate at all costs.

Said estate had been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of its current owner, Emmanuel Trident de Hortense. This designation was based on reports of the presence of an unrecognized monster on the lands of said estate.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster determined to be a giant centipede (in Elder Speech: Yghern, W3 classification: insectoid, number of individuals: 3 (in words: three)). The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 13% to take into account a non-obligatory tithe for the construction of a monument to the Prophet Lebioda and was paid immediately in species.

Never shall I forget what I have been through… I was attacked by giant fire-breathing creatures, power monstrosities akin to drowners crossed with endregae, men with the faces of wild animals… Yet Lebioda smiled on me and saw fit to let me survive this harrying gauntlet. At its end – here, in the Hidden Chapel – I surrendered myself to meditation and immediately He filled my mind with a vision of a lake whose crystal clear waters surrounded me, penetrated my soul and cleansed it of all wickedness and villainy… when I awoke, I was certain what Lebioda had designated as the last station on my pilgrimage: the Lake of Cleansing, where Lebioda healed the bodies and spirits of his followers. <br><br>Following the advice of the sage known as the Great Beggar, in whose wisdom I basked at the Temple of Lebioda (I pray all is well with him and the people of his village have understood he only speaks the truth and means them no harm), I shall now leave behind further things binding me to my former life. Doing so is not easy, however, for acquiring these diagrams once cost me a great deal of time, energy and sacrifice. But I know this is the right path. Let Lebioda accept my humble offering.<br><br>I now continue onward, towards the Lake of Cleansing. Though my road is difficult and full of sacrifices, it grows ever more straight and clear and I feel a lightness in my soul. My certainty I walk the right path grows strong as iron, firm as steel.

   1206746|8bd9fc9e||Beledal: The True Story of a Poultry-Raising Genius<br><br>Malcolm Beledal came into this world in a small village to the north of Beauclair. He expressed great interest in all kinds of farming from his earliest years. He began by growing beets and onions, but soon grew bored of them, for vegetables were too inert for his energetic disposition. He then switched tracks and tried farming his friends. He locked them in an old shed and fed them hay for a week. The boys laughed at first, but soon became angry with him. Ultimately, they managed to scratch a hole in the shed’s thatch and climb out. Little Beledal’s hyperactivity finally proved useful to him then, for he had to run quite a long time before his friends finally gave up the chase. This adventure taught him an important lesson: friends make poor farm animals.<br><br>As vegetables and friends were out of question, Beledal decided to focus on animals. He started farming ants. He took a huge ant colony, put it in a bucket and placed the bucket on a window sill. Tragically, Beledal forgot it was the middle of summer and sun pounded down relentlessly. The very next morning, all the ants were roasted. Beledal ate them up, then decided to try farming bigger animals next time.<br><br>He began raising a pig, but soon took a liking to her. He named her Betsy and walked her every day. One evening, while scoffing down a braised pork knuckle, he learned it had belonged to Betsy. Oh, what torment that was for young Beledal! Desperate, he even tried to take his own life. However, after several years passed, Beledal decided to give his passion for farming one more chance. He raised a flock of chickens. They were much livelier than vegetables, considerably bigger than ants and not as intelligent as pigs. Beledal’s passion bloomed as never before. Over the years, he developed his farm so much that he became a legend.

   1205928|8c40c73e||During the reign of Duchess Caroberta, Toussaint was visited by a certain disciple of the Prophet Lebioda named Plegmund. His words and deeds – which included miracles – were so persuasive, soon nearly the entire duchy had converted to the new faith. They crowned this outburst of religiosity with the construction of a temple dedicated to the prophet, but that was not enough for Plegmund. He convinced the duchess to build a statue of Lebioda - the likes of which the world had never seen.

You err, I assure you. I truly did have a horrible migraine. I thought my horns were going to fall off! It must have something to do with the phase of the moon.<br><br>I heard a witcher has come to Beauclair again, the same one you had to save me from all those years ago.<br><br>Should I be worried?

   1185221|8d486f17||It all went off without a hitch. Bartolomé de Launay proved a poncy fool, just like I thought. Witcher fell right into our trap, too – put too much stock in his skills, thought he could handle anything. At first we acted like bored thugs, just picking our noses and waiting for our pay. When de Launay and the witcher finally came to terms, the witcher let slip he was hiding the rest of the diagrams in the Pits of Brume. Dangerous place, that, but maybe we’ll find some safe route to the witcher’s cache.<br><br>One bolt from the black took care of de Launay. Expected more trouble from the witcher, so we hit him with a couple – good thing, too, because he still had a good heap of life in him, though he couldn’t even get up off his belly. I let the lads check just how much pain a witcher can stomach. They’d earned a bit of recreation after the fine job they’d done. Then we grabbed the coin of de Launay and soon we’re off to the Pits of Brume to get those precious diagrams and sell for all we can.

   1205920|8dc25efc||To listen to the old folks’ jabber, this place was once home to Whispess – a woodland witch eager to help any in need. When Whispess peered into a certain knight’s heart, she saw that it was black and refused him aid. The knight reacted with wrath and burned the witch alive in her cave. Soon afterward, the knight went mad and killed himself – claiming he was tortured by a strange voice whispering in his ear that no one else could hear.

   1135720|8de33a5b||My Notes and Observations<br>Professor Shakeslock<br>The circle O’Dimm created terrifies me. I cannot see it, but I know it is here. I know no name for the sense with which I perceive it. When I near its bounds, strange shivers shoot down my spine. This is not pain, but something that stands my hair on edge like a hedgehog’s quivers.<br><br>A month has passed, and still I stay within the runic circle. Nightmares prey on me more and more. I’ve come to fear sleep. I know not how long I can withstand this.<br><br>I dreamt I had a daughter. This was strange, for I’ve never had children, yet one came to me in my sleep. She was no older than ten. She called me “daddy” and loved me deeply. I could see it in her eyes. The strangest part of all was that I also burned for her with a great paternal love. Can one possibly dream of someone who does not exist? Can one love such a one?<br><br>I no longer fear sleep. Perhaps O’Dimm has decided to give me peace. I have no desire to change his mind.<br><br>My dreams of Amelie give me great joy. My daughter is a good and clever girl. I believe she will grow into a wonderful woman. A shame she exists only in my dreams. Not only do I no longer fear sleep, but now I cannot wait for the moment in which it comes. What a fantastic transformation! If nothing changes, I shall soon try to leave the circle.<br><br>I know now why I dreamt for weeks of the child I never had. It was his doing. This night my daughter died. She caught a strange illness which pocked her whole body with hideous, oozing sores. She cried, begging me to help. I could do nothing. She died in my arms. I awoke soaked with sweat. I remain a wreck, my mind tattered.<br><br>Three months have passed since Amelie’s death. My heart still bleeds, and horrifying visions plague my every moment. I’m a blind man who wishes he saw nothing, for utter blindness would be a relief compared to these tormenting visions.<br><br>I cannot persevere much longer. I have become a deeply unhappy old man.<br><br>I have now lived within the magic circle for a year. Thoughts of suicide haunt my mind ever more often. It would be so simple – I need but step outside the runes…

   1194399|938378dc||As per your orders, Filibert, we joined Conrad Veidt’s “expedition.” A truly dense fool, that one. Set out from Caravista meaning to reach Lan Exeter on his own – and best part is, he wasn’t going to do any trading along the way! Said he’d made a bet with some pals that he could reach his goal in less than eighty days.<br><br>His wagon was chock full of supplies, along with an altogether weighty trunk of Nilfgaardian florens attached to the coach box. We drank and ate all night at the Pheasantry, on his coin. I’ve still got heartburn. Didn’t hesitate a moment before agreeing to let us join him on his journey. Our suggestion to pitch camp outside the city didn’t raise the slightest suspicion. Near finished the job without even getting our hands dirty, but alas… Zuëzan swung the hammer a bit too weakly, skull didn’t crack at once, and even though that cretin was drunk as a lord, he howled bloody murder and spooked the horses. To make things worse, they were already harnessed, so they dragged the wagon straight into the lake.<br><br>We’re eager to get the blazes out of here quick as possible, because this place is crawling with those bleeding knights errant and Ducal Guardsmen, but as if out of spite, the wagon’s got stuck in the mud… [a large ink blot renders the rest of the report illegible]

After all, things have been very tight at the vineyard these last days…<br><br>This extremely mysterious gentleman has turned out to be equally extremely wealthy.

Yes, yes, I know, it takes a great deal of patience and you have to separate the wheat from the chaff, but it’s the best way to learn about local legends. That’s how we came to find Fox Hollow, where they say the soil sprouts clay pots (!).<br><br>28th of July<br>We dug up part of a vineyard on the outskirts of Fox Hollow, but what we found there… those were not pots, those were elven funeral urns! It seems the village is built atop an ancient Aen Siedhe necropolis... That cemetery dates, by my reckoning, to the time before the First Landing, so the graves might be full of valuables. The ancient elves buried their dead along with great wealth. We’ve already dug up a few choice baubles, but I’m sure if we look deeper we will find much more.<br><br>12th of August<br>Today we started a new dig, in a new location. Matthias spied a beautifully ornamented cameo in the ground, and when he tried to grab it… he discovered it was clenched in the hands of a skeleton. Anselm started to mock him, but quickly lost all desire to laugh. The valley was full of elven skeletons – men, women, even children... The bodies were all mixed, with limbs lopped off, many heads missing and children with crushed rib cages… what happened here?!<br><br>14th of August<br>Another sleepless night. Blood, cries, wails… I awake drenched in sweat, then I doze off for a moment and the same happens again. I told my fellows to dig a deep hole We’ll throw that cursed cameo inside – it belongs in the ground, with the rest of the dead.<br><br>16th of August<br>Matthias disappeared during the night. No one saw him leave camp, his things are all in place… Anselm says we should follow his example and flee while we still live, but I… I cannot leave it like this! This valley is full of bones… Anselm screamed in my face, called me a madman, but I MUST tell someone what we have found. They say there is a group of archeologists from Castel Graupian at the Termes ruins… [rest is covered in blood]

A father who must abandon his own child ceased to be a father, and his heart shall never know comfort. Sadly, as a result of what has happened I have no other choice. We, along with the rest of the household, must abandon our estate. It is because that curse took you from us, leaving in your stead a mindless, bloodthirsty creature.<br><br>We shall go north, to Kovir, and if you ever read this letter (which could only mean you have returned to human form) you are to look for us there. For my part I can only promise each year I will send an envoy who will be tasked with checking in on you, seeing if you are alive and, if so, in what form. Faith that you will once again be my beloved Marlene gives me the strength to live on. Perhaps the curse will not last forever. Perhaps someone will come along you can lift this burden from you.<br><br>Farewell.<br><br>Your Loving Father

   1206235|984c057e||The fiendish slurpers of blood—the vampyres, so-called—the dead and yet alive, called by others—are cunning beasts—verily, some suspect they even reason and converse—yet beasts they remain. These vampyres lead solitary existences—even their beastly and abominable ilk, they shun. The bloodslurpers are not idly named, for the blood of other beings is their bread. They hack apart their victims with sharp claws—daggers, in truth, though of one with their flesh. Upon feasting thus they grow in foul force and can turn into flying rats—gaining these animals’ keen hearing and also a sense of smell to match that of hound or hind.<br> <br>It is our luck seasoned hunters of bloodslurpers know ruses with which to trick these horrors and slay them without excessive risk. To kill a vampire easily and surely, it is enough to lure him into the light of the sun. He will then disintegrate into a fine dust at once, ready to be scattered to the four corners of the earth by the next gust. Yet well-advised is it to further equip oneself with garlic, lest the horror crawl too close and strike out at the hunter with its dagger-claws. Vampyres fear garlic with all-consuming terror—the mere smell of it reduces them to violent heaving and sobbing. In this moment should the hunter pound into the beast’s heart a sharpened stake—the second best weapon (the first being the sun) for the killing of the bloodslurpers.

The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br> The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 25% to take into account swordplay making use of more than one weapon and immediate payment in species.

What’s key is for folk in the village keep their mouths shut tight. They do that, how will anyone find out he even made it to Fox Hollow? He could’ve been killed by vandaguilders along the way, could he not? Just go tell Séverin to pour quicklime down that hole and drop in a torch, just in case. Quicklime, that’ll do the trick, turn both that smarty-trousers’ body and those old skeletons into molten sludge in a snap. For who the bumblazes knows when the next scholar will show?

Only a portion of the notes have survived.]<br><br>Day 134<br>I came across the remains of a destroyed golem in the swamps outside Vizima… Words cannot describe the rage that overcame me. The brickmakers who  keep a settlement nearby told me this act of vandalism was perpetrated by some white-haired witcher. I had heard the members of that guild were vile whoresons, but to stoop to that!<br><br>Day 163<br>The idea struck me that I might find something of use in the Oxenfurt Academy archive. I managed, with great difficulty, to cross the Pontar, but once in Oxenfurt I met with an unpleasant surprise – the Academy has been closed! Luckily I was able to gain entry thanks to the help of a professor acquaintance of mine (thank you, Slavoy!). I thus was able to dig out a few dust-covered beauties and… eureka! Near the village of Heddel there’s a tower which (purportedly) once served as a workshop to none other than Master Alzur himself!<br><br>Day 164<br>I made it to the tower. It’s inhabited. A rather eccentric gentleman has made it a roost for his flock of... harpies. I saw him feed their chicks pork! Inconceivable! But let’s return to our core concern. The tower which this loon has turned into a harpy nest truly might have once been Alzur’s workshop. That means this might be the very place where he conducted his research into golems… <br><br>Day 165<br>It’s here! Standing motionless in a stone circle! The local peasants think it’s merely a strangely-formed boulder, but then again, how could such bumpkins ever guess they pass a masterpiece of magic construction on the way to feed their chickens! I’ve already fastened a lightning conductor. It's a shame there are no druids nearby. If I hadn’t slept through my course on meteorological magic, I’d summon a storm myself, but as it is, I can but wait, patiently or otherwise…<br><br>Day 171<br>Been sitting on these cold stones waiting for a change in the weather so long my bowels have almost frozen, but it’s finally here! I must stop writing now for drops are falling on my notebook and smearing my notes. The first rumblings of thunder sound in the distance! I cannot contain my excitement. Soon, the golem shall live again!

His Most Gracious Majesty Radovid the Fifth of Redania is not interested in your offer in the slightest. Be warned that if you do not cease and desist your deranged experiments at once, we will send a detachment of the military gendarmerie to your tower – that is, if those monsters you are rearing do not kill you first. The idea of a Royal Air Force made up of harpies in Redanian uniforms is a supreme idiocy with which His Most Gracious Majesty does not want any involvement.<br><br>Martin Yefimov<br>Chancellery of His Most Gracious Majesty, Radovid the Fifth of Redania

Some he hid in the deepest cave he could find, the one in the northern portion of the Kaer Morhen valley. Others he hid in the  abandoned, crumbling watchtower in the same area. Still others he placed amidst the rocks on the shore of the valley's lake.

   1209022|a2d5a8a5||For many years, it was erroneously believed slyzards were simply wyverns in their highest stage of development. One “scholar,” whose completion of an academic course of study must have been the result of no small miracle, heatedly defended this point of view in a “scientific” work whose title I shall mercifully withhold. His main line of reasoning was an absurd and completely off the mark parallel drawn between the developmental cycles of the slyzard and pieris brassicae, also known as the cabbage butterfly. “A slyzard” – claimed the author – “is nothing but a fully mature wyvern that has developed fire glands.”<br><br>Utter rubbish! Let it be known once and for all that Charles von Linné is a filthy fopdoodle and an uneducated knucklehead - a slyzard is not by any means the same beast as a wyvern!

The once wealthy Redanian family's manor and lands were auctioned off after they fell deeply in debt, but were returned to von Everec hands by Olgierd, the infamous leader of an informal band of armed men calling themselves the Redanian Free Company. Despite the effort he went through to regain it, Olgierd abandoned the residence some time later, and dark legends concerning it now circulate among its neighbors.

In short, a scholar for damned certain. We showed him the diagram and asked nicely what’s written there. He said he didn’t rightly know, but looked like Ofieri or some other such strange tongue. Naturally we warmed his sides a bit, to see if that wouldn’t happen to aid his reading, but the blasted weakling went and died on us. Still, seems now that--

   1190170|a39e102a||Dear Martina Crisca,<br><br>Congratulations on being promoted to the Imperial Academy at Castel Graupian. I’m sure you’ll quickly become one of that institution’s premier scholars! Yet before you set off for Nilfgaard, I, old Victor Monnart, would like to ask you for a small favor. You know my sons, you played together as children – so you know how hard it is to coax them to get along. I feel in my bones it will soon come time for me to leave this vale of tears, yet I shall go with a heavy heart knowing Auguste, Hugo and Lucien will go at each other’s throats as soon as I pass. Thus I have dismantled my famed still into three parts and ask you, my darling Martina, to hide them from my sons. Perhaps searching together for the missing pieces of a machine which will give them wealth will bind them together and forever put an end to these foolish quarrels. In exchange for your trouble, I have included a modest pouch of coin. I wish you good luck!<br><br>Your Devoted Servant,<br>Victor Monnart

   1185301|a3c0d60d||The witcher I summoned reached Ussar on the 12th of September. He made a favorable impression. I had expected a cold killer, yet found myself speaking with someone who could easily be mistaken for a normal man – if not for his expansive knowledge concerning the habits of monsters, the two swords on his back and the griffin-head medallion on his chest. Jerome, as he was called, asked me a great many questions about the beast seen near Mont Crane castle. Based on my responses he concluded the monster in question was a leshen.<br><br>During our next conversation the witcher expressed his astonishment at being offered such a high reward, and one paid in advance, before he even arrived in Toussaint. I had taken a liking to the fellow and wanted to be honest with him. Despite the vow I had sworn, I revealed his pay came entirely from a certain Moreau, a mage, who had decided to use this gift to thank our community for a warm welcome.<br><br>When Jerome heard the mage’s name, he first went pale, then flew into a rage. He shouted, and I quote: “Gonna give that old bastard a piece of my mind!”,  then ran to the stables, mounted his steed and rode off, leaving the greater part of his possessions behind. He was seen on the road to Mont Crane, but then disappeared, like a rock thrown in deep water. Master Moreau claims he never saw the witcher.

"It must be a leshen or another monster of some sort, enraged by my insolent theft of the forest’s treasures!" - I thought.<br><br>Luckily, it turned out the beast was no leshen, but a little panther!<br><br>Full of pity, I decided to share the bread and dried meat I brought in my bundle with the cub.<br><br>From that moment on, I brought the panther something to eat every day, and every day it waited for me next to the juniper.<br><br>A year passed and the panther grew so big I was afraid to approach it, so I would just throw bits of meat and leave as quickly as possible.<br><br>Then a sickness left me bedridden for a month. When I was finally back on my feet, I went to the woods, to the juniper shrub.

I fear what I shall find there… I think I lack the strength to face the truth.<br><br>That impertinent upstart Philipp Borutt is driving me completely mad! He’s accused ME of idleness and indecision! How dare he hurl such insults in the presence of the other members of our expedition?! He does not understand who my beloved Isabelle was, who she IS to me! I... I do not wish to – I cannot face the truth.<br><br>I’m off. Alone, at the moment, for I do not wish them to see me when I find… I will begin by searching the ruins of the temple abutting the river.

   1209222|a5f195b5||In the course of my research into bruxae, I have stumbled upon certain inconsistencies that in no way correspond with what we already know about these dangerous vampires. My investigations have revealed that these seemingly erroneous accounts were in fact describing an alp, not a bruxa! It is an extraordinary discovery, a true milestone in the classification of these monsters.<br><br>Even though legends tell of these vampires turning into pitch black hounds or venomous toads, personally, I do not believe an alp is capable of such polymorphy. However, it is almost certain that, similarly to a bruxa, an alp may transform itself into a beautiful woman. This ability allows the species to blend seamlessly into crowds. To think that I may have passed such a monster completely unawares – fascinating!<br><br>One of the fundamental differences between alps and bruxae is their fighting style when in the form of a vampire. Alps also possess the ability to turn into fog, which allow them to move noiselessly and attack by surprise. Most likely this is the root of the name common folk have given them: "fleetlings."

Through the window I see a storm is brewing and rain will soon begin to pour… Dogs howl to the moon and the cats have begun their nighttime serenades… This will be a difficult night… And I feel a strange unease… Could it be this is not the end of the story?

   1205918|a7ee6bf9||Built during the reign of Duchess Caroberta, this bridge was meant to facilitate traffic between vineyards on opposite banks of the Sansretour. It was named after a pilgrim quite popular in Toussaint at the time, a certain disciple of the Prophet Lebioda who on this very spot performed one of his many miracles: traversing the river without getting his feet wet.

Never been a jelly-kneed milksop, mind, but one look at this lot and I near soiled my hose. Why, just the other day they picked up this chap in the woods who was out gathering mushrooms, all bright eyes and innocence. After an hour of our lads having their “fun” with the fellow, he was begging to be sent to his makers. Soon as he said as much, Fourfingers pointed his remaining digits straight at me. I wasn’t surprised -- being new and all, it was only natural I had to prove my chops – but nor was I exactly eager. But what could I do? Hold my nose and slit the boy’s throat, that’s what.<br><br>Ugh, I can still feel the sickly warmth of his blood on my hands, no matter how much emulsion I use. Don’t get me wrong, I’d killed before – but always in self-defense, or at least in circumstances which a generous mind or a shrewd barrister could cast in that mold. But no barrister will do me any good if the lads find out my stomach curdled when I did the deed. Then it’s out of the club with me, and that’s the best case scenario, if Filibert’s in a lenient mood. Otherwise… why, I don’t even want to think about it.

   1209954|ac5f1303||Dear Geralt,<br><br>If you are reading these words, it means I am already far beyond the borders of Toussaint and you have found my Mutagenerator. (Of course, you may dub this instrument however you like, perhaps something more fitting to your taste or better reflecting its function, for I have no doubt your knowledge on the subject of mutagens is far more profound and thorough than mine!)<br><br>I have been working on this device in my spare time, but now it is finished and I am convinced – as convinced as an inventor can be before his invention has been used as intended – of the usefulness of this apparatus.<br><br>You are surely wondering what function it is meant to serve. As the name indicates, the Mutagenerator generates mutagens. It operates by absorbing electromagical energy waves from bodies (in this case, the bodies of the monsters and evil-doers you kill) – and when it has absorbed enough so as to be charged a critical amount, the Mutagenerator changes the stored energy into a Greater Mutagen – which, I suspect, you will make good use of. <br><br>As you surely understand, I am an amateur engineer, which is why you must forgive the lack of an ability for you to direct this operation. Which mutagen emerges as a result is determined at random, meaning chance will decide if it is a Green, Red or Blue Mutagen. Chance – yet I have noted the colors tend to alternate, by and large.<br>I trust you shall find my gift useful.<br><br>Your dearly devoted friend,<br> Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy<br><br>P.S. You might be wondering why  I decided to toss the Mutagenerator into your home instead of simply handing it to you in person. Well, you must know I did it out of modesty. Believe it or not. <br>Take care, Geralt – and may my gift serve you well.

Potential entrepreneurs were scared off by the bloody legend of Waltharius the Burly and since the area had never produced wines worthy of historical mention anyways, they had little incentive to conquer this fear. The estate’s most recent owner, however - a nobleman named Roderick - decided to plant vines along the slopes stretching from the Blessure and Sansretour valleys up to the keep. As a precaution, he also planted olive groves, a much surer investment.

   1209385|aec15a29||Lady Dulcinea was a noblewoman at Duchess Caroberta’s court. According to legend, whenever she appeared duels knights would duel for her favor and noblewomen would faint out of jealousy. Yet rather than accepting the advances of one of her gentlemen suitors, Lady Dulcinea, tired of the pomp of the ducal court, agreed to the proposal of a simple miller and abandoned the palace to dwell with him in his mill. Word is, she lived there happily ever after.
   1135925|aec37fe1||Bowdon was founded by writ of King Heribert the Quarrelsome. Unfortunately, the king was roaring drunk when they asked him to indicate on the map where to build the new settlement and slammed his finger down in the middle of a swamp. Those forced to settle there soon abandoned the unpleasant bog. Their empty dwellings became shelter for vagabonds and bandits.

Few, however, realize the duchy’s lands are rich with deposits of slate and other valuable building materials, and that the quarrying of such was once the bedrock of local livelihoods. Thus when gods-fearing Toussaintois saw fit to build a statue of the saintly Lebioda, they had no need to send for materials from abroad – instead, they merely reactivated Ardaiso.

   1213514|b3242852||Ducal Chronicle, Tome LVI, Lammas – Saovine, 1268 [excerpts]<br><br>In the month preceding the celebrations surrounding the Festival of the Vat, the Ducal Couple and a delegation of notables embarked on a neighborly visit to the court of Queen Calanthe of Cintra. The visit had both a social and a political dimension, for the duchess was hoping Queen Calanthe would follow the dictates of international protocol and repay with a visit of her own, perferably during the above-mentioned Festival, thus gracing the celebration with her royal presence.<br><br>The ducal couple was accompanied by both daughters, Syanna and Anarietta. It is worth mentioning here that both infants are sprouting like beanpoles and it shall not belong before it will be necessary to find them husbands. In the case of the elder daughter, Syanna, this should not prove a problem, as suitors will flock from all over the civilized world for the chance to be husband to the future duchess, especially when they see her portrait, which will not even require much embellishment. Things are somewhat different in the case of young Anarietta, who is overly thin and furthermore auburn haired. The hope remains, however, that time will add to her charms. As for character and imagination, neither girl is lacking in either quality in the least.

They’ve been coming in droves lately to join our hanse – in fact, I’ve had to start turning some away! Sadly, most of the newcomers are dung-booted jelly diddlers – send that lot to demand coin from a caravan, and even the horses would soil themselves laughing. That’s why I’ve put Carlo in charge of drilling the new recruits. He’s pitched camp to the south of Lynx Crag – that rock where the witch lives. I despise such old wenches like plaguey vapors and would gladly fix up a pyre for her, but after what happened at the Cutterin Estate… Bet my own danglies that was her doing, so we’d best leave her be.<br><br>Day 167<br>It’s decided. Within two sundowns, everyone’s going to be talking about my band’s ride through Fox Hollow. My lads deserve some fun – and there are plenty of men to gut and wenches to diddle there, so we’re in for quite a ball. Rumor going around claims clay pots grow from the ground in those parts. If it’s true, perhaps I’ll gather up a gaggle of those peasants, put them to work digging up that pottery and we’ll open up shop. Every organization’s got to stay nimble and agile these days. So we’ll pivot, instead of slaughtering merchants and knights – we’ll sell teapots!<br><br><br>Day 182<br>Felt like my spirit was trying to crawl out my bum, that’s how badly our kitchen crew botched our last batch of vittles. When knights errant attacked us after that, not a man among us was strong enough to hold a sword. We’ve got to get our hands on a real cook – only thing more dangerous than an imbecile with a sword is an imbecile in charge of a cooking pot. Perhaps a quick raid of the Cockatrice?

   1205910|b438036d||Tradition is sacred in Toussaint. This fair duchy has a great many traditions, perhaps the most hallowed of which are the spectacular knightly tourneys held during nearly every important local festival. These events have earned fame and respect not only in all of Nilfgaard, but in the North as well. Thus knights journey from almost literally the entire world to enter the lists and gain glory testing their mettle against each other and the best of Toussaint chivarly.

The visit had both a social and a political dimension, for the duchess was hoping Queen Calanthe would follow the dictates of international protocol and repay with a visit of her own, perferably during the above-mentioned Festival, thus gracing the celebration with her royal presence.<br><br>The ducal couple was accompanied by their daughter, Anarietta. It is worth mentioning here that the infant is sprouting like a beanpole and it shall not belong before it will be necessary to find her a husband. Time will surely add to her charms. As for character and imagination, she is not lacking either quality in the least.

Stick to well-frequented roads and avoid out-of-the-way areas. Roaming the city alone is not advised. As long as the Beast prowls the streets, no one is safe. At the same time, Her Illustrious Highness, Duchess Anna Henrietta would like to make it known she is doing everything in her power to ensure this state of emergency ends as soon as possible.

During the spring run-off, the Sansretour becomes very dangerous to navigate and local exporters turn to transport methods less likely to result in catastrophic loss. These merchants group together into caravans, hire guards and set out with their goods overland. Their favored destination? Metinna, whose capital is likewise named Metinna, leading some Toussaintois to joke their wine is medicine for that kingdom’s fabled lack of imagination.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to make an appearance. My health has taken a sudden turn for the worse. The medics don't see much hope for me. Oh well... everyone shall have their turn, as our father would say. I've had a good life and do not regret anything. Well, except perhaps for a few choice cards I lost over the years, but you cannot gain without risking something.<br><br>This very well might be the last letter I write to you, so I'd like you to know I am very proud of you. A gwent tournament using the new faciton, that is the idea of a lifetime. Do not worry about those who oppose your changes - and indeed the notion of change itself. There shall always be malcontents. Those such as yourself should let intuition guide them and follow the path of progress. Where would our world be today if we allowed only the nearsighted, the unimaginative, to steer our affairs? No doubt stuck in a dark cave, with warming fires and illuminating candles beyond our reckoning. Thus I retain high hopes for your tournament and wish it all the best. I believe it shall soon be the finest, most prestigious gwent tournament in all the world. <br><br>Your brother – Igor.

   1208423|be2b643f||My beloved Seraphine has a lover. I’m not going to rend my garments, curse the gods or swear vengeance. My Seraphine brims with so much life energy, it was inevitable some would spill over into other canals. It is now up to me to cut off those spillways, vanquish my rival and hope the walls I erect will prove sufficient to satisfy her vitality and give us a life of mutual exuberance… I have already forgiven her. Now I need but meet her beau and remove him from our life. <br><br>Yesterday I followed Seraphine. They hold their trysts at the Olive Grove – how romantic. When they met... Birds flew over the grove. A whole flock… Twittering and chirping. As if celebrating the lovers’ joy… and as if mocking me cruelly…  how symbolic.<br><br>I can see this romance drain my darling wife. Since she began seeing this… her lover, she has become anemic, eternally pale. She wanders the house at night aimlessly, blindly. She used to be so lively, so radiant, yet now she is listless, apathetic, resigned. I must gather my courage and end their relationship as soon as possible.<br><br>I, Christophe Dugarry, despise violence. I shall resolve the matter of my wife’s lover pragmatically. I have prepared a full sack of Nilfgaardian florens, one so heavy I can barely lift it. I shall wait for my Seraphine to return from the grove to our residence and then I shall catch him… and make him an offer he cannot refuse. Saint Lebioda, give me strength!

   1188301|c3f5389c||Signs can deal critical hits. Their critical hit chance and damage increase with Sign Intensity (currently $S$% chance to deal an additional $S$% damage). Opponents killed by critical hits from Signs explode.
   1188303|c3f5389d||Each fatal blow dealt by a sword dismembers the enemy or activates a finisher. Each blow dealt by a weapon in melee combat increases Attack Power by $S$% until combat ends (to a maximum of $S$%). The bonus is lost if you take damage (not including damage from Toxicity).
   1188305|c3f5389e||Each time you are injured in melee combat, the attacking opponent receives damage in the amount of $S$% of damage dealt for every point of your Toxicity level (currently $S$%, to a maximum of $S$%).
   1188307|c3f5389f||Each Adrenaline Point decreases damage received by $S$% (to a maximum of $S$%).
   1188309|c3f538a0||When the Aard Sign is cast, it additionally has a $S$% chance of freezing opponents. Opponents knocked down and frozen simultaneously die immediately. Opponents who are not frozen are dealt an additional $S$ damage.
   1188311|c3f538a1||At start of combat, sword Attack Power and Sign Intensity increase for $S$s by $S$% for each foe (after first). So, when fighting $S$ foes, the bonus is $S$%. Once it wears off, sword Attack Power and Sign Intensity drop by $S$% for each participating foe after first (modifier cannot exceed $S$%). Duration: $S$s.
   1188313|c3f538a2||Sword attacks deal $S$% more damage to human opponents immune to counterattacks and monsters. In all other cases, if the attacker's Vitality is less than $S$%, a counterattack immediately triggers a finisher.
   1188315|c3f538a3||Crossbow damage is now increased from $S$ to $S$ (values depend on crossbow used), and crossbow critical hit chance is increased by $S$%. Crossbow bolts pierce and knock down or stun opponents. Opponents struck when they have full Vitality lose $S$% of Vitality.

   1207937|c6a10b78||To Brother Tailles of Dorndal:<br>CONFIDENTIAL<br>Dear Tailles,<br>The Guiding Brethren of our Holy Congregation have unanimously declared it high time one of our Knights joined the lists of the Beauclair tourney. This is an event renowned the world over and the lack of a representative of our order is a glaring omission and casts a dark shadow on the reputation of our Order.<br><br>Sadly, ever since the death of Brother Roderick de Wett, we have no worthy champion, and our most skilled brother, Patrick of Weyze, has contracted scrofula so fierce he cannot mount a horse even for a minute.<br><br>We thus trust the choice of you, brother, which is natural in this situation, will prove wise and you shall not betray the hope we have placed in you.<br><br>Immediately upon receipt of this letter go to the nearest branch of the Vivaldi Bank, where you will accept a transfer of coin in the amount of 784 crowns. These are your delegation funds, which you are obliged to return in full plus a 50% penalty if you do not take a place on the podium. Brother Adalbert, who – as you know – has taken on the role of specialist in the matters of the Order’s view in the public eye, has calculated that a loss on the part of our representative will cause more damage than not taking part in the tourney at all. So you understand our position.<br>May the Eternally Flaming Rose lie your path in this endeavor!<br><br>Brother Evariste of Metinna, First Secretary of the Order

If it carries on, although I can't stand witchcraft and sorcery, I'll have to visit a herbalist.<br><br>The dizziness has not gone away. Worst of all, it's been joined by pain, so strong that at times I cannot see.<br><br>I've been to the herbalist. A repulsive old crone looked at me like she had seen a monster. She gave me some cursed mixture that I have to drink twice a day. It's not helping at all.<br><br>Today, like everyday, I looked in the mirror and I was lost for words. I usually check that I don't have any wrinkles or bags under my eyes, but today... There are no wrinkles, but I'd rather that there were. I have hair growing on my breasts. It's horrible. It's got to be because of those damned herbs…<br><br>I went to the herbalist to smash her face in, but her chambers were empty. She must have known what would happen to me and legged it.<br><br>My family is starting to suspect something, although I am cutting the hair back, which is growing back faster and faster… <br><br>I've tried to put the idea out of my head, but I can't hold it back any longer. Maybe it wasn't the herbs that have lead to this, but a curse placed upon me by an old beggar whom I had to chase off one time. I have to find out. I want to hire someone who can find the herbalist. <br><br>I cannot think and it is getting hard to write. <br><br>Loneliness. No family… <br><br>Eat. I want to eat. Not a good spoon. Empty spoons. <br><Br>Nothing. Eat. It hurts… <br><br>Mirror. Lies. No. <br><br>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

   1208393|c7805449||My Darling Jossellin,<br><br>I trust this letter finds you in good health. You are aware – for how could you not be! – of the wild passion I feel for you and how overwhelmingly I long for you to become my husband. Yet since we are to stand together at the marital altar, surely you also understand I need to garb myself appropriately, to prepare a wardrobe befitting such a moment. I already have an organdy dress, but no slippers! I’ve heard the latest rage in the Empire are slippers made of giant centipede hide, so I ask you, my darling love, to hunt such a beast for me. Or two. To be sure the shoemaker doesn’t run out of material.<br><br>Bella de Gunness
   1113901|c799bcb6||Brethren!<br><br>I write you now in my own blood, so you may now what fate befell me.<br><br>Following M’s orders, I traveled to Novigrad to resupply and sell our latest batch of fisstech. I left the men in my command on our boat along with the goods and the coin while I went to the hut on the beach to await WJ’s men. When they arrived, it was well after dark, and one of them bore a linen sack on his back. This sack did not contain the promised Novigrad crowns – instead, it held the heads of my men. The scoundrels demanded to know where the fisstech was, but I only told them about the case on the ship, which they will never open without the key. My choice to slip this into my arse shortly before they caught me proved wise, for they searched everywhere else. Though they interrogated me harshly, I withheld the truth. Instead I insisted one of the men they murdered on the ship was carrying the key, and my role was merely to negotiate. They wanted to kill me at once, but their captain had another idea at the last minute. They locked me in this becursed cage, to wither and die slowly from hunger and thirst.<br><br>The second day of my captivity I heard the screams of my captors. I know not whether I saw true or visions, but it seemed drowners had emerged from the water and were devouring the whoresons alive. Yet the problem remains that they (the whoresons, not the drowners) have so securely locked me in I see no means of escape…<br><br>I have sat here six days now. I stopped feeling hunger after the third, my guts having turned in on themselves. Now I dream only of drink. I’d give all the gold in the world for a sip of water. It could be rank and full of larvae, and still I would guzzle it greedily… I drank my own urine for the first few days, but I no longer produce any.<br><br>I have nothing left. Not even hope. The last thing keeping me sane is the task of writing this letter to you. Farewell.<br>Anselm

   1214224|cba8e67a||I’ve decided! I shall ask her tomorrow. A man only lives once!<br>We agreed to meet at our usual place at noon. Clarissa has asked for a half-day off, and I’ll sneak away from the chancellery. That old fogey of a supervisor will never notice I’m missing. And even if he did, so what! I’m young, I’ll find other work.<br>Although… if Clarissa found out I’d lost my job, she might not agree… I’d have proposed to her ages ago, were I not aware how much she fears a life of poverty. She’s never said as much, but I can see it worries her.<br>But what are we waiting for? Together we shall live more economically than apart, and finally we shall not have constantly to scheme up ways to meet here!<br>I wanted to invite her to dine at the best eatery in all of Beauclair… So many times I have imagined what it would be like. Waiters decked out in golden livery would bring us foie gras and sorbets. Clarissa would sit on a satin cushion, a raven-black crown of hair on her head and looking beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all the room.  Then, I would pull out a diamond ring.<br>But the truth is I shall never be able to afford all that, not even if Clarissa were to insist a ring of simple silver would be enough for her and we’d be better of spending that coin to buy a house in Hauteville, where we could open up a shop and she could sell hats.<br>Thus I shall propose to her tomorrow, in the abandoned wine cave which serves as our meeting place, our cozy sanctuary where we have spent so many pleasant hours together. She never complained that our only romantic moments have been spent surrounded by cobwebs and old barrels of wine. But tomorrow marks the end of all that! Once we are wed, I will carry her across my threshold. It will be tight quarters, but there will be room enough for a bed. And there will be no cobwebs.<br>I’ve only a simple copper ring for her, with a red glass jewel of the cheapest sort. But I promise in a year’s time I will exchange it for a silver one, with an amethyst, or maybe even a ruby!<br>O, Clarissa! Tomorrow cannot come soon enough!<br>I think I shall not be able to fall asleep tonight.

The barrels of wine themselves are extremely valuable, yet traveling with the caravan was the undersecretary responsible for returning the embassy’s unused operation wherewithal.

All the residents of this settlement must live in constant twilight and darkness for these long months. Yet soon, this perennial torture will be but a dark memory! My invention is brilliant in its simplicity. Atop one of the nearby mountains, I shall install a system of mirrors to reflect the rays of the sun towards her manor! That’s it! Haha! It was worth it, all those long nights spent at the Imperial Academy Library during my studies, perfecting my skills in arithmetic and alchemy!<br><br>I would like to test my discovery today, but father keeps shouting that my “contraption” will only attract a few feeble-minded magpies to doodoo all over our abode, or, even worse, bring in a flock of harpies – but he’s always got a problem with everything! I’ll wait until he leaves for town, then set up my mirrors in a flash!

   1206938|cd7ddd87||I’d always enjoyed practicing my craft. Killing came as naturally to me as blowing my nose. They raised me to be a knight, and being a brigand’s not much different. First, blood and swords, then wine and harlots to wash the worries away. But ever since that horrid night… everything has changed. My dreams are filled with nightmares in which I relive those events, step by step…<br><br>We took the estate by storm and pulled Maximus Macrinus out of his bedding, still in his nighties. Yet we had to put off dealing with him and first see to his family. Those were our orders, like it or not, but… it’s one thing to impale some corpulent cow-diddler with a wine-stained mustache and quite another to string up a snot-nosed runt. He squealed like a little girl when the lads threw the noose around his neck. Macrinus tried to buy us off – even showed me the candlestick lever that opens the hidden vault where he hides his family treasures, but Filibert’s orders were clear.<br><br>Next up was Maximus’ wife… the lads spent a long time having their way with her and making Maximus watch. Too long. I didn’t know the harlotsbrood and haven’t a clue what he did to Filibert to make him wish such a fate on him and his family, but… That was too much for me. Only once his whole clan was swinging did we turn our attention to Macrinus. We stuck him with hot pokers, cut off his ears, then slit his gut… and he… throughout all this horror he didn’t scream once. Only groaned under his breath. When it came time for him to die, in a puddle of his own excrement, under the tree where we’d hanged his wife and son… he looked me in the eyes and whispered, “Vengeance will be mine! In this life, or the next!” Those were his last words. Dark clouds filled the sky in that instant, and a harsh gale sprung up… Then I gave the order to move out.<br><br>I remember perfectly how, when I reported this back to Filibert, he was all smiles. Happy as a clam. Didn’t even harangue me for not looting the manor. It was clear he cared about one thing, and one thing only: Macrinus’ death.<br><br>Yet news of the treasure we left at Casteldaccia quickly spread around Mont Crane and a few lads from our hanse are fixing to head over there to see what they can find. I’ll join them. I’ll bury the remains still lying there, in the yard – maybe then their spirits will know peace. Maybe I’ll wipe away at least some of my sins. Maybe at last I’ll be able to sleep soundly.

   1205969|ce293f09||One of the most extraordinary individuals I have encountered during my numerous adventures at Geralt’s side was the vampire known as Regis. To be precise, he was known as Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy. By his own reckoning, he was 428 years old and was the descendant of unfortunate beings trapped in our world during the Conjunction of Spheres.<br>You are surely thinking, Dear Reader, about katakans alps and other such monsters and are pondering how it was that the witcher – who, it must be admitted, is a slayer of monsters – came to keep such company. I must here explain that Regis was a higher vampire, a creature which physically does not differ all that much from a man. Higher vampires are also much more powerful than their wild confreres, and their regenerative abilities significantly outpace those of anything else you have encountered or can even imagine.<br><br>But it is not because of his outer appearances or inner strengths that Regis became our dear companion. True, he could be pretentious and rather pompous in his frequent length perorations, but one would be hard-pressed to find in him the haughtiness usually present in higher beings.<br><br>Regis valued human life dearly and refused to kill unless forced to do so. As he once confessed, higher vampires do not in fact need to drink blood at all in order to survive. They treat it somewhat as we treat alcohol. A rough grasp of this dynamic might be given to you by the fact that, when we met him, Regis had been abstinent for years.<br><br>He never revealed to us why he decided to join our search for Ciri. He had never met her before. Nor did he live to see her. He died at Stygg Castle, during the battle against the mad mage Vilgefortz, who was responsible for the whole affair. He died for a cause which he surely did not fully understand, but he did it to defend those he held dear and simply because it was the right thing to do.<br><br>I shall always remember him as an rural surgeon reeking of herbs – that is how he came to us during our first encounter at the Fen Carn necropolis, when he treated me and my companions to a fantastic brew he made from mandrake root. Wherever you are, my friend, bottoms up!

And lo and behold, what did the Most Holy Flames illuminate for me there? A hive of hardened heathens, too lost in sin to lift a cursed finger to care for the hearth of the Eternal Fire! Filled with divine wrath, I ask them, "Why's your chapel in such a sorry state?! Why's your cemetery all covered in weeds?!" Their response? "Ghosts! Curses fallen upon hallowed ground." They blame it on the ealdorman's wife, say she went mad from riches and… [illegible fragment] ... and ever since that tragedy, chapel's lain in ruins, with no one daring to go near. So the task falls on me to guide these foolish lost sheep back on the righteous path and away from the rubbish they believe. I intend to enter the chapel alone, armed only with the torch of the Eternal Fire to light my path, and see just what lurks within...

   1209260|cfc3ae0a||Some monsters are born out of necessity – not because they are cruel, but because they have to defend themselves. For them, it is hunt or be hunted. Others are simply a mistake of nature, beasts brought to life by an evolutionary hiccup, so to speak. Both these sorts of monsters we are able to fight.<br><br>But there are also monsters born of sin. Wherever there is cruelty and envy, wherever earth has been drenched in blood and rocks soaked in suffering, there the hellhounds have their home. And as cruelty spreads, so, too, shall these monsters. They are the reflection of us and to defeat them would mean to defeat ourselves. All that is left is to wait until we are torn to shreds by hordes of these demonic dogs.

The court medics’ healing brews provided no succor and King Divethaf did not last the night. At that moment our morale, which had already suffered a great trial during the weeks-long siege, reached rock-bottom. But were we to allow the body of our leader to fall into the hands of the Dh’oine? Let them put his head on a pike?<br><br>The mage Barrfhionn did not have to ponder long. The king’s place is in his family crypt, in Cyttorhak. I was one of the volunteers who carried the body from the palace through underground tunnels.<br><br>Yet somehow the Dh’oine picked up our trail and attacked us in the temple. After a short battle, we made a unanimous decision. Barrfhionn shall leave and close the entrance to the crypts behind him. We shall stay behind and place the king in his grave. The mage hesitated a short while, yet knew the palace would fall without his support. He left, swearing he would soon return, once our troops have fought off the Dh’oine with the help of General Saempolinh, whose army should reach us any day now. [rest of letter illegible]

Got to scrounge up a few florens somehow, or this might end badly for me.<br><br>24th Day of Service<br>Overheard the ambassador give instructions to his secretary. In the coming days, they’ll send a transport carrying wine bought for the imperial court, along with some “unused operational wherewithal.” My guess – they mean a sack stuffed with florens! Information like that could be worth a fortune to a lad from the right part of town…<br><br>27th Day of Service<br>Graybill Pellegrin slaughtered the caravan’s guards, snatched all its cargo. Had the gall to deliver a pouch of coin to me at the embassy. Said it was my share. I spit on his coin, but I’m afraid I’ll need it, soon enough… I hid what he gave me in a safe place. Ever since Old Ralph died, no one buys wooden planters anymore, so his workshop’s the perfect hiding spot.<br><br>29th Day of Service<br>Graybill told me to keep my ears open at the embassy, find out when they’ll have another caravan to grab. As if as an afterthought, he added the guard commander would be quite shocked to learn about my role in the previous hijacking… I stole the next convoy’s route from the secretary’s office. It’s the price I must pay for my idiot idea of going in cahoots with Graybill Pellegrin.<br><br>31st Day of Service<br>The transport’s set off. This time it’s escorted by Arnold aep Bluhm – commander of the embassy guard. Graybill’s men don’t know they’re in for - a fight against elite soldiers. When he finds out… Then it’s time to get out of here. Coin I set aside should be enough to start afresh, somewhere far, far away. Maecht seems like a good direction.

I have carried out tests in my laboratory on people and I discovered that a mother subject to appropriate stimuli is able to forget about her child and think only about how to avoid pain. So fear would be similar to pain? <br>H.B. - No. Pain rules the body, but fear is born in the heart. <br>E.H. - Oooh yes… What you say is very interesting… I think I will have to examine your heart in the laboratory. <br>H.B. - What do you mean… examine? <br>E.H. - I mean examine.

   1194261|d43ef608||This hanse’s mighty odd. All these grizzled men with hard eyes, lads with hundreds of murders under their belts, and near half of them sit around all evening scribbling in a journal or writing letters. Where’d all these blasted scholars come from? My lord managed to beat letters into my head before I seduced his daughter and he chased me off, but someone like Sylvain Blacktooth – how’d he master the art of writing while traveling with a circus and sweeping dung from the cages? Just lately I was sitting guard with three other lads, and instead of sipping on wine, farting into the fire, normal stuff, they all sat there quietly jotting things into their notebooks. What really scares me is that maybe Starling Straggen likes the company of “literates” of this sort and I’m going to have to start a journal myself…

   1208914|d4813d2e||Day 1<br><br>I have stumbled upon an extremely curious species – the venomous archespore. So far, I have managed to distinguish three of its varieties, distinguished by colors: green (the most common), yellow and finally black, which not only exhibit the most aggression, but also show the extraordinary ability to pollinate plants near instantaneously. <br><br>Day 5<br><br>My research into archespores continues. I think I have reached the point where observation is no longer enough to bring satisfying results. The species attacks mainly using a mandible located in the center of its flower, although when highly threatened, it may also spit toxic fluid. I was also able to discover archespores are particularly sensitive to fire, which may prove a useful piece of information regarding how to neutralize them if necessary.<br><br>Day 6<br><br>I have made up my mind.

Holy Lebioda must have given me a kindly wink today, or perhaps it was mere chance and circumstance – the important thing is, I’ve found a cave that will make a perfect wine cellar! Production’s been going wonderfully the last few seasons and lack of storage space has become a pressing issue. I could have hired men to dig a cellar, but I’d hate to slow work on barreling the grapes, and at any rate, no dug out cellar can match a limestone cavern.<br><br>The one I found is perfect – spacious and not at all overly damp. And I came across it thoroughly by accident, while strolling among the rocks. My foot slipped into a crevasse, and when I tugged it free a few stones fell down into it. I listened for a long while before I heard them hit the bottom. I then walked around the entire slope until I finally found an entrance!<Br><br>Tomorrow we will begin turning it into a storehouse and transferring the barrels.<br><br>[Later entry, consisting of hurriedly scrawled entries] Monsters in cave. Huge centipedes. Men barely escaped. We’ll try to go again, recover what we can. Must block off all entrances. Hope no one else ever stumbles into that accursed cave…

Dark eyes, nose clearly has been broken repeatedly.<br>Distinguishing Marks: Arm cut off below the elbow. Adalard usually covers his stump with the sleeve of his shirt or coat. Sometimes he wears a prosthetic.<br>Area of Operations: primarily Hauteville, but it is suspected he has contacts throughout Beauclair.<br><br>One-Armed Adalard is suspected of forging at least fifty paintings, along with their certificates of authenticity. Said paintings can be found in the collections of the private collectors defrauded by Adalard. The forgery was uncovered due to an error on the part of the fraudster: one of his middlemen offered to sell Countess de Boussut “Belhaven Fields.” The Countess immediately alerted the Guard – for he had just tried to sell her a painting which has been in her family for generations.

Load up a cart with barrels of that new spiced wine and in the night, quiet as a mouse, haul it away from the estate. Head northwest, and when you cross the stream, you’ll find men waiting for you. Give them the barrels. They must be desperate to get this wine, because merely as down payment they’ve handed me a pleasantly heavy pouch… Just be careful, because a pair of those vile rock trolls hunt in the Blessure Valley. How’d trolls end up there, you ask? They were imported! For the tourney, for knights to battle for the crowd’s amusement. Thing is, they fled the transport and began slaughtering their way across the land.<br><br>P.S. Hide the share of the down payment I’ve sent, because if someone finds you with that kind of coin, they’ll start asking questions and our business will end quicker than it began.<br><br>P.P.S.

The above-mentioned criminal was wanted for a broad range of murders and other unlawful deeds – including the massacre at Fox Hollow – which he committed in co-malfeasance with his outlaw organization (henceforth: “hanse”). This hanse had for some time occupied the caves known as Tulasens. Using said real estate as their base of operations, they conducted numerous plunderous raids on merchants, traders and other such mercantile expeditions, extending in fact to any individuals displaying signs of carrying material goods of any worth on their persons.<br>The proceedings directed against said Loth Halfbreed, wanted by writ of law in Angren and Toussaint, were brought to a close by the witcher known as Geralt, who, acting on behalf of Her Illustrious Grace, conducted a summary field execution of the criminal and all his subordinates.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 18% to take into account water use fees and immediate payment in species.

Daddy gets cross when I ask him when he will earn some and once he nearly hit me. My friends have beautiful toys. Laura has a teddy bear, and Michelle has a doll with golden hair that you can brush with a real comb.<br><br>I worry that I will never have a toy, which is why I am writing to you, Master Shopkeeper. I wanted to write this letter to you a long time ago, but I didn't know how to write then. Now I know. If you have a pretty toy that other children don't want, I will look after it. It will be happy with me. Please don't laugh at me. I know I am little, but I also know that toys are not really alive. They only live in our imagination. But so what? I would love it very much. <br><br>Iza.

   1207797|d973e108||The year 781 marked the final end of elven rule in Toussaint – the closing of an era that had lasted over one and a half thousand years.<br><br>The elves abandoned their ivory cities and left for the mountains, taking with them all that they could and destroying everything else. Whatever they could not take and did not manage to demolish or burn, they cursed.<br><br>The last elven sovereign, Divethaf, hundreds of years old yet fair as a youth, was defeated. Weeping over the slain army of his forever-young brothers and sisters, he agreed to pay homage to Ludovic, the first human king of Toussaint (who, though young, was as shrunken and ugly as the night after Saovine).<br><br>Putting on no end of airs and graces, Ludovic boasted, “Look – the proud elf shall bow down before me and kiss my royal feet with humility!” To degrade Divethaf even further, Ludovic decided the homage should take place in the elf king’s barely-abandoned palace. The throne on which Ludovic now boldly lounged bore still-smoldering marks from the fire set by the elves, who had sought to burn the whole palace down as they left.<br><br>So the proud elven king bowed down before the human king and offered him a sacrifice of bread and wine, as well as his sword and shield.<br><br>Spewing out merciless mockery all the while, Ludovic received this homage, then immediately ordered his guards drag Divethaf beyond the palace gates and throw him down the stairs as if he were a beggar.<br><br>Witnesses claimed the proud elf remained calm throughout the whole event, but when left alone, Divethaf wiped the blood off his face and vowed cruel revenge on the king – revenge that would come from stone as cold as the king’s heart.<br><br>Yet these ominous words bore no fruit, for in the year 782, before the homage was renewed, Divethaf drew his last breath alongside his remaining soldiers when the Toussaintois decided to celebrate the anniversary of the surrender of the elven sovereign with a pogrom of non-humans on the slopes of Mount Gorgon. Few survived.

Said estate had been declared a “Site Hazardous to the Health and/or Life of All Who Visit” on request of its current owner, Sonnier d’Arc. This designation was based on reports of the presence of an unrecognized monster of the giant or possibly troll sort on the lands of said estate.<br>As a result of the professional intervention of the witcher known as Geralt, the danger has been vanquished and the monster determined to be a cyclops (W3 classification: ogroid). The extermination was carried out using a legally registered silver sword.<br>The standard pay for the completion of such a task was lowered by 4% to take into account the sunshine tax (in effect during summer months) and immediate payment in species.

To isolate the infected from the healthy, by ducal decree a leper colony was created on Crane Island. When all the colony’s inhabitants died, the complex gradually fell into ruin and the decision was made to adapt it into a prison, which it remains to this day.

   1108371|e5632e7b||I write in great haste, for each moment might bring my demise. A band of peasants wielding all manner of sharp or heavy farmyard implements has stormed the keep. I was in the workshop when they attacked, working on a new silver sword diagram, and did not notice the mob's approach. I have barricaded the doors but know this cannot last forever. I can only hope Varin will come and rescue me before they break through.<br><br>Luckily we completed work on a new steel sword diagram a few days ago and gave it to Varin to forge. Armed with this fine weapon and aided by his witcher pupils, I'm sure he'll easily handle a bunch of peasants swinging hoes and rakes. Yet even rakes can do great harm to an unarmed scholar such as my master. Hieronymus has been shut up in his tower for days, absorbed in his work on a new armor diagram. He might remain oblivious still to the danger he is in. Should the mob find him before Varin can slice them down... <br><br>And to think I nearly escaped this nightmare! If I had only listened to my master... Hieronymus had drawn up some notes for me on locations connected with the legendary Elgar, a witcher of the School of the Wolf. It is said Elgar had devised some improvements to the School's gear, and I was to follow his trail in search of these diagrams. Had I left even as late as yesterday, I would have been a safe distance from Kaer Morhen by the time the mob attacked. Instead, I tarried, and now I cower, fearing for my life...

I have no idea what we were served, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it had been the corpse of a raftsman fished out of the river.

Maybe I will start with a warning: it's pure madness. Assuming that you survive teleportation -- and opening a stable portal several dozen meters above the ground is, as you know, highly risky -- you will then be torn to shreds. As much as Vampires Superiores are actually rational creatures with developed cognitive and analytical functions, other species may be less open to attempts to make contact.<br><br>If by chance you do live to have an audience with this Unseen Elder, do the following immediately: genuflect, say words of greeting in their language -- "eclthi, lautni ama" -- and place on the ground the attached Haakland aragonite crystal as a gift. Then, and only then, is there the slightest chance that you will be heard. But, by the gods, speak quickly and don't waste your words.<br><br>-Jochen Brandt

I can't deny it, she is far from normal. When I visited her, I saw her sniff at a handful of straw as if it were the most irresistible of perfumes (I took a sniff as well, smelled just like a normal wisp of straw to me). She won't look you in the eye, but animals take to her like bees to honey. My tomcat is old and had been getting rather sickly. But after two days at the druidess', he's full of vim and vinegar once more! He chases mice like he used to and has a hearty appetite.

Everywhere you turn, there's a jiggling rear end poking out from behind a tree, and there's no way to explain this to an impressionable child. That's why I advise you to take your children elsewhere for fresh air, maybe somewhere less lovely, but more decent.<br><br>An Outraged Mother

   1208561|e9e2d7c0||The de la Croix family never had much luck in business. Their grapevines fell victim to Duke Adam of Nazair’s attempts to regulate the flow of the Sansretour and their olive groves were devoured by a plague of armored scale insects. After this, they restored their old water mill, counting on the production of bread to be their ticket to success. And it nearly was - until they found out the hard way high concentrations of flour in restricted spaces can lead to powerful dust explosions.

Yet Count Jean-Joel Baillairgé – that’s what the impertinent prick made me call him –managed to assuage my irritation a dab by clinking a hefty pouch of Nilfgaardian florens on the table... [illegible fragment] ...his entourage loaded the ship with bundles, then hauled on this huge cage covered with a sail. Count Baillairgé explained it held one of those famed Zanguebarian striped horses – a gift for Duchess Henrietta.<br><br>Belhaven to Beauclair Route, 24th Day of Service<br>We’ve had nothing but trouble with this Zanguebarian horse! It gnaws on the deck like a beast gone mad. Plus we’ve got to make sure the tarp covering its cage is tightly fastened, for it seems this creature’s as sensitive to the sun’s rays as a vampire! In which case, what good’s it to the duchess, a striped horse she can only ride it at night? There’s no comprehending these aristocrats… [illegible fragment]<br><br>Belhaven – Beauclair Route, 25th Day of Service<br>A thousand thundering sea devils! That was no horse in that cage, but a gods-blasted shaelmaar! Overgrown rock rat chewed through the deck, capsized the ship and burrowed into the river bottom! Then that idiot Count Baillairgé fell to his knees and begged me to help catch the monster. He handed me the key to the chest of jewels he’d kept close watch on the whole trip and swore it’d be mine if we recaptured that monstrosity. I’d most like to grab a thick club, smack him upside the head and take that chest right now, but I’m not some ploughing pirate. I’ll gather the lads who managed to survive the wreck and we’ll try to catch the monster in our nets – the count claimed to know some trickery to use to sneak up on the beast...

Dressed as a man and calling herself by a false name, she served as a squire. Just before being dubbed a knight, she revealed her true identity and was forced into exile. She lived in the desert and, as the mysterious Heron Knight, defended pilgrims. She fought at the Battle of Cervantes Pass, where she was badly wounded and taken to the field hospital, where she was recognized.<br><br>We know the duke, moved by her courage, dubbed her a knight and she then became the heroine of many tales which describe the righteousness of her character and generosity of her spirit.<br><br>Alondra’s disappearance remains shrouded in mystery.  The most popular legend claims the knight was summoned by the Lady of the Lake and journeyed to the bottom of the lake to see here, where she remains to this day, as the guardian of that subterranean domain.

The Beast’s dismembered corpse had been found in the river’s shallows, tangled in the man’s nets. The victim was identified as Count de la Croix.<br><br>The evidence suggesting this was the Beast’s third victim were the wounds to the body’s rib cage, which were dealt by long claws and constituted the immediate cause of death. It is not known why the Beast dismembered the body. Perhaps this was a matter of staging to provoke certain connotations, as in the case of the two previous victims.<br><br>No additional objects or tracks were found near the body. Count de la Croix’s personal effects most probably were carried off by the river’s current.

Few, however, know how close the world came to losing its slightly acrid, surprisingly deep aftertaste. The cause of this averted disaster was Phylloxera Mortifera, that is to say, Phylloxera the Deadly, a species of aphid whose sudden attack nearly wiped out all existing vines of this variety. For many weeks no one was able to exterminate this pest and it seemed Pomino was doomed to extinction. In the end, however, the aphids were defeated by ducal alchemists and a carefully selected group of vintners was appointed to ensure its vines took root at Castel Ravello once more. Some experts from the time of the plague claim their restoration efforts introduced cross-contaminants and never again were they able to extract from this grape that same bottomless flavor as before.

   1122954|f1632238||There once was a young woman named Marlene and a young man named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was so handsome no maid could tear her eyes off him. Every maid in the village, from the fairest to the plainest, yearned to win his favor.<br><br>Marlene, too, was struck by his beauty and soon fell in love with him, as a love as deep as only a first love can be. This feeling was so overwhelming, Marlene realized she could never live without Bartholomew. Yet it was her misfortune that by then Bartholomew already had a wife and a young son.<br><br>Marlene refused to give in to this misfortune, however, and worked long and hard to convince Bartholomew that she was his one true love. In the end she succeeded, for women possess the gift of persuasion and many a man has succumbed to their entreaties.<br><br>Bartholomew’s wife refused to accept his change of heart. But Marlene found a way to deal with that as well.<br><br>Marlene convinced Bartholomew he must get rid of his wife once and for all, and so he chopped off her head. Everything would have ended well, with the young lovers living happily ever after, had not the crime been witnessed by Bartholomew’s five-year-old son. Marlene saw no other solution than to convince Bartholomew, by now her rightful husband, to dispose of the child like his mother and bury his body next to hers, so that they might be together for all eternity.<br><br>Yet this time Bartholomew put his foot down and refused to do what Marlene asked of him. “It is one thing to kill my wife, but to kill my child, the fruit of my loins?” he said. He only changed his mind when the lad began to speak, loudly and frequently, about what he had seen. And though Bartholomew could never raise his hand against his firstborn son, he found another way to deal with the problem. While the boy slept, he snuck into his room, lifted him up and set him in a coffin, which he then buried under the apple tree in their yard.<br><br>After that day, strange things began occurring in the area where the couple lived. The trees lost their leaves and stopped bearing fruit. Folk dwelling nearby were hounded by evil dreams. One by one they fled their homes and farmsteads, until only Marlene and Bartholomew were left.<br><br>One day Marlene dreamt the boy had awoken in his casket under the apple tree and begun to cry. She yearned to have a child of her own and such dreams troubled her greatly. She thus took a spade and dug up the coffin. Inside she found the child’s body, but its arms or legs were missing. She thought the poor lad must have gnawed them off from wild hunger before he died. The sight of the child’s mangled torso so terrified Marlene she reburied the coffin at once and never said a word about it to her husband.<br><br>They lived together a great many years afterwards, but theirs was not a good life. Bartholomew had changed. He slowly stopped cherishing Marlene, and then stopped speaking. He hanged himself on the night of the summer solstice, leaving his wife alone with her dreams. Before she died, Marlene dug up the child’s coffin one more time. No one knows where she went and what she did with it. Their lands have lain deserted ever since. No plants will grow there, and no birds sing.<br><br>Wilhelm & Jacob G.

   1205903|f1a9467d||There was a time when the Cockatrice’s owner, Adam de Guy, loved to recount the tale of how the inn got its name. In his youth, his story went, he served as squire to a knight errant and together they defeated a bloodthirsty cockatrice. The beast’s head decorated the auberge’s entrance for many years until a certain traveler from Oxenfurt ascertained it was unfortunately but a rather amateurish hobbling together of pheasant, weasel and pig parts. His pride wounded, de Guy took down his trophy, but the inn kept its name.
   1208566|f1c43e55||It is widely accepted that vampires came into our world during the Conjunction of the Spheres. They quickly spread across all the Continent, trying to adapt to their new situation. According to legend, one of them, Khagmar, settled in Toussaint. Grim tales are whispered about his deeds, but whether he truly even existed is hard to say. The tales do agree on one thing, however: Khagmar’s story is inextricably tied to the mysterious fortress known as Tesham Mutna.
   1205995|f1d166e2||Dear Master Levassieur,<br><br>I know you track outlaws for pay. I've an unusual assignment for you. No doubt you wonder why I have drawn you out here, and why we cannot meet in person. You see, in my present situation, any kind of meeting is very risky – not so much for me, as for the person with whom I meet, for I am afflicted by a curse, or (as I hope, and why I have turned to you), the side effects of medicine given to me some time ago by a herbalist.<br><br>Soon after I visited this herbalist, she disappeared without trace. I desperately wish to understand my illness, so I wish to hire you to find her. When you do, learn as much from her as you can about the medicine she gave me. If my suffering is a result of her wickedness, then make her provide an antidote. I assure you I have ample wealth and will reward you with no small part of it for your services.<br><br>If it turns out my suffering is not the fault of the herbalist, please let her go. I will then have a different task for you, because this shall mean I am afflicted by a terrible curse which only the gods can cure. I believe it was cast upon me by a certain beggar who came by the manor while I was hosting a soiree for a few friends. If you can find that vagrant, I will pay you double. Sadly, all I remember of him is that he sold mirrors. I am aware this is not much aid for your hunt, yet I trust in your considerable talents and wish you the best of luck.<br><br>Marlene de Trastamara

   1126469|f2e3df17||Kulik Kulikov and his men are busy preparing the hunt, so I’ve a few moments to write up this whole incredible affair.<br><br>Week back I arrived home in Oxenfurt after a long journey and found I’d received a letter from my barrister. My aunt Helena had finally passed on and left all her belongings, including her hut outside Novigrad, to me. The letter included a copy of her will and a key to the chest in which she had stashed her savings. Remembering how my dear auntie would serve her guests only bread and water, I was sure she’d managed to save up a hefty stash of coin during her long and miserly life. So I raced off in a flash to my aunt’s hut, to pay my respects at her grave, and while there, take a gander at what’s in that chest. But when I got there, the hut was in ruins and the neighboring peasants were claiming a griffin had nested on my aunt’s lands. So there I was, a fortune in arm’s reach, and not a way to get at it. So I went back to Oxenfurt and raced to the Alchemy, fast as my feet would take me, for I’d heard the famous Kulik Kulikov and his crew were watering their horses there after their latest adventure. We agreed terms quick enough (he’d get a portion of what we found in the chest) and set off to exterminate this ploughing pest of a griffin.<br><br>Now I’m sitting and watching Kulikov’s lads arm the ballista, writing this all down to calm my nerves and pass the time.<br><br>Fun’s about to start!

I think to myself – that there’s an ill omen.<br><br>I light my pipe, hunt down some bread, then pull on my galoshes and head to the water. It's cool out, so I think, maybe I should go fetch a thicker jacket. But I don't, for it's getting warmer already, the sun being out now. But the sky, it's still blood red... An ill omen.<br><br>Once I get by the water, I look, and there caught up in the nets is a human head. It was already bright, so I could see it staring at me, all bug eyed.<br><br>I look around, not a living soul to be seen. So I shoot off to town, to fetch the Guard.<br><br>I stand there, watching them gather up the bits, and I think to myself, the Beast’s done this, sure as day.<br><br>That’s how it was.

I know, only a real blackguard enjoys another’s funeral, but that wench was as grouchy a miser as they come. No one liked her, not even a little. So why’m I writing about her? Because I happen know the old wench left behind a sizeable stash of gold, her being so damn stingy all her rotten life and not having any weans to leave anything to. So I’m going to her cellar this evening to look around, see what I can find. You take your lass (my sister, treat her right, you bastard) and head to Stacheier soon as you can. We’ll all buy ourselves a manor and drink, eat and shite to excess till the end of our merry days!<br><br>Your Brother,<br>Greggs<br><br>P.S.

You could say that a supply of fresh blood arrived. They have no idea what they are in for. My only comfort is that I know already and I won't have to live through the terror that I felt the first time they came for me.

By this I do not mean any old meadow in which two cutpurses slaughtered a merchant, but a true battle field strewn with strips of human flesh. If after seeing such a sight the potential novice does not fall into convulsions and run weeping for the Great Mother's mercy, there is a chance he will prove of some use in the future.<br><br>Each student should begin by working on the dead. A badly stitched corpse will bear no grudges. Once the beginning surgeon can tell hands from feet, he can be assigned to work on non-terminal patients.<br><br>A surgeon is not a miracle worker.

A small trappers’ post located on its outskirts has grown into the tranquil village known as Francollarts. Here hunters, woodcutters and beekeepers come to sell the fruit of the woods. The village springs to life once a year, when Baron Trastamara organizes his annual Wood Festival and invites all the court out for a spectacular hunt.

   1208563|fb48e6c0||Ussar Castle constitutes part of the series of fortifications constructed during the reign of Duke Roger the Reveler. Sadly, it turned out his master builders were as fond of the bottle as he, the result being structural flaws in the building’s foundations. The sloppily-placed stones proved unable to bear the weight of the walls and the castle collapsed. Many years later the ruins were reconstructed into a small fort to house knights protecting the high road, but currently it lies empty and abandoned.

In 1178 the structure was restored so it could stage the works of Beauclair’s most renowned theatrical virtuosos. Unfortunately, its grand opening was marred by an unplanned tragic ending: the mysterious death of the play’s leading lady. Ever since, the place has been deemed cursed and few dare venture anywhere near it.

   1208902|fef8348b||Order for the Reorganization and Reform of Bastoy Prison<br><br>To the warden:<br><br>By decree of His Illustrious Grace, Duc Henri III, Jacques Olex, warden of Bastoy Prison, is required to implement the following reforms:<br>1. Dismiss half of the prison’s guard staff<Br>2. Forbid the use of corporal force against the inmates<br>3. Discontinue punishment by dark cells, limited rations and flogging<br>4. Permit the prisoners to possess private property<br>5. Allow prisoners to walk at will around the penitentiary grounds<br>6. Purchase, using the included funds, vittles of the finest quality, and hire a teacher to instruct in reading and writing and purchase any equipment necessary for said instruction.<br><br>His Illustrious Grace Duke Henri III believes these changes, based on models popular in the more civilized lands of the South, will result in a lowering of the rate of crime in all the Duchy, by showing young offenders a pathway to a new life.<br><br>Junior Clerk<br>Philipp-Jordi Simbardo
   1206027|ff0f171e||Based on my observations, I have concluded all species, be they plant, animal or even insect, are inextricably intertwined with one another. It is no mere coincidence the felling of the beech woods and the vanishing of the roes who in them once dwelled led to the disappearance of the sterling basilisks as well!<br><br>The principle even holds true for ladybirds.<br><br>For the betterment of learning, I conducted the following experiment: I eradicated all the aphids in the palace cabbage patch (using a lye solution). Within a few weeks, all of the ladybirds once present in that patch – and there were hundreds – migrated to a neighboring field. A simple experiment, yet it gave incontrovertible proof of my hypothesis!

   1160332|ff3eecc7||[sheet 1]<br>Count Crespi called himself a knight, but spat in the face of chivalry. That's why he should not die with a sword in his hand, but atone for his dishonor on the town pillory. He was a rogue and he should die a rogue's death.<br><br>[sheet 2]<br>You did well with Count Crespi. He got what he deserved. Now it's time for Ramon du Lac. That idiot thought he was smarter than a new penny, always issuing his judgments, which broke people's futures and necks. He was a fool and should die like a fool: alone, with no weapon, in a dark alley. With a broken neck.<br><br>[sheet 3]<br>Count de la Croix committed the basest of acts out of his love for money, he tore to shreds the hearts of those who trusted him. That is why you will cut him to pieces, and attach the coin pouch accompanying this letter to his body.<br><br>[sheet 4]<br>Your penultimate victim is Milton de Peyrac-Peyran. He who should have shown valor in the defense of the innocent, turned out to be the greatest coward of the Beauclair knighthood. That is why he must die like a coward - you will kill him during the tournament, when the Hare Hunt commences in the ducal gardens. Milton will be the hare. He will escape. Like a coward. Then you will hunt him down and kill him - just like a hunter kills a coward.

   1051805|00000000||We've come a long way, and I'll be damned if we've come to fail. It'll be all right.

   1123762|00000000||Haven't killed me yet.
   1123760|00000000||You always say that.
   1123766|00000000||Try? Take it back. That was a great joke.
   1123764|00000000||Ah, Geralt. You're so charming when you try to be funny.
   1123771|00000000||I love you, you know.
   1123768|00000000||Mhm. Sure.
   1123754|00000000||So what am I supposed to think about?
   1123752|00000000||Can't think about that.
   1123758|00000000||I'll manage.

   1123783|00000000||Love you too.
   1123780|00000000||You trying to make me cry? Ciri'd never let me forget it. Go on, get.
   1123674|00000000||Can't wait till we leave for Kovir.
   1123679|00000000||Geralt! Are you suggesting we--?
   1123676|00000000||Hm. There's a lighthouse not far from here, you know.
   1123698|00000000||No. Because the days, yeah, days might be short, but the nights? Nights'll be long.
   1123696|00000000||It won't?
   1123702|00000000||Unbelievable. You said something romantic! You, Geralt of Rivia!
   1123700|00000000||I can't wait.
   1123707|00000000||Well, none of those during the battle, please. If anything should happen to you…
   1123709|00000000||I'll be fine.
   1123708|00000000||Don't think about that.
   1123681|00000000||No… well, at least not right now. Just wanted to say…
   1123686|00000000||Moment of weakness.
   1123684|00000000||Wanted to say that since… since Novigrad, whenever I see the beam of a lighthouse, I feel good. Thinking of you.
   1123690|00000000||And what do you think about?
   1123688|00000000||All this snow… it makes me think of Kovir.
   1123694|00000000||And you know what? It won't bother me one bit.
   1123692|00000000||That it's like this all year there. Dark and cold.
   1123505|00000000||No. No more about the battle.
   1123509|00000000||There's a lighthouse not far from here…
   1123508|00000000||Just hold me. And say something nice.
   1123499|00000000||Triss? Everything all right?
   1123503|00000000||Chin up. The Hunt's weakened. We've got--
   1123501|00000000||Yes. I just wanted a moment to talk to you. Before… before it begins.
    554882|00000000||No. I-I mean, yes, of course I am. Thus far the Lodge has oft banked on weak rulers. It's been one of our biggest mistakes.
    554819|00000000||So she's not told you anything? What about personal plans?
    559512|00000000||Hm. Definitely advise against trying that.
   1061773|00000000||I see no reason for pity. He done got chummy with the Black Ones. Just deserts.

   1127010|00000000||Tsk… Oh Geralt… What've you gotten yourself into now?
   1127014|00000000||Afraid not. And I doubt anyone else'll be able to, either. So sorry.
   1127012|00000000||Long story. Can you get rid of this thing?
   1127016|00000000||Agh… Folk give me strange looks anyway. Guess I  oughta be used to it.
   1123986|00000000||Holding up all right?
   1123985|00000000||Putrid Grove, when we first saw each other again…
   1123739|00000000||I know that now.
   1123736|00000000||But it turned out my amnesia'd changed nothing. Wanted to be with you before, during, after - always.
   1123715|00000000||Figured as much. You weren't easy to find, you know.
   1123713|00000000||Honestly? "Oh no, not him again."
   1123717|00000000||You'd recovered your memory, found Yennefer. So naturally, I thought the two of you'd--
   1123774|00000000||You, uh, holding up all right?
   1123778|00000000||You know what I mean.
   1123776|00000000||Ugh, it'll be a hard slog for everyone…
   1123786|00000000||I guess so. I just don't want you to--
   1123784|00000000||What'm I supposed to say? I mean, I knew you and Yennefer… that you'd end up back together. It was a lost cause, always.
   1123791|00000000||Right. Understood.
   1123789|00000000||Can we not dwell on it? I need to focus on other things now.
   1123711|00000000||So, there you were in Putrid Grove, and out of nowhere I show up. What did you think?
    416000|00000000||Laughed and said, "How tasty, best sausage I have seen!"
    415996|00000000||One, two, three, the one to fetch the kindling's… thee!
    422223|00000000||Greetings! Is it herbs you seek? Medicines to mute a bashful maid's inhibitions, or a concoction to raise your own courage for a second go?
    419057|00000000||I'd be your best - and last.
    421001|00000000||A spot o' cider for ye? Or a bit o' dry curd? Me larder's not exactly burstin', but what I've got's sure to please.
    438545|00000000||Aye, master. Forgive us for not remarkin' on it earlier, please…
    450077|00000000||Nay, never. There's boletes, goatheads, penny buns… No magic mushrooms - pth! Just our own, you know, for ordinary folk.
    452958|00000000||Wanted to help Gran. She's always been good to the children. Would've been the doldrums out here without 'em, she'd 'ave died of boredom. Begged the Crones not to hurt Gran, but they were angry she'd let the children escape.
    489306|00000000||Don't worry. You shan't leave empty-handed.
    487140|00000000||Why was Ciri interested in a curse?
    498892|00000000||Call it what you will. You must sail 'cross the Great Sea, find the isle of Ard Skellig. There, in the Sacred Grove, the learned Master Gremist will judge whether you're fit to be his pupil.

   1029771|00000000||Awwwrr!
   1029744|00000000||They near refused to let us cross the Pontar, yet they let this sort right in. Pff. Scandalous.

   1029738|00000000||You--! You boor!
   1029740|00000000||What're you…? What on earth are you doing?!
   1031847|00000000||And exhausting. Ugh, to fall onto a featherbed and sleep till… well, till I woke.

   1044388|00000000||Exactly what I plan to do. I've always dreamed of having my own cabaret. A bit of paint and plaster and this place will do splendidly.

   1067240|00000000||What can I do for ye, traveler?
   1074145|00000000||Sky cells - nice idea for a prison without bars. Shame he didn't know how to fly.
   1126970|00000000||Listen… this mark - can you do anything about it?
   1126975|00000000||I'm not joking, Yen.
   1126973|00000000||I can scratch it if it itches, but I fear that's all.
   1126979|00000000||Dammit.
   1126977|00000000||Neither am I. These symbols… it's ancient, powerful magic. I've no notion how to remove them.
   1126982|00000000||This mark - help me get rid of it?
   1126981|00000000||You're still one of the prettiest witchers around in my book. Second only to Lambert.
   1123984|00000000||Our encounter with the djinn - feeling any effects?
   1123983|00000000||Yen, wanted to talk about me and Triss…
   1123799|00000000||Yes. Now I feel… regret.
   1123797|00000000||So, feel any different after our encounter with the djinn?
   1123802|00000000||Mean to say that--?
   1123805|00000000||That I regret we didn't try that earlier. Much earlier.
   1123826|00000000||Come, now, Geralt. I know you. Well enough to know exactly what's going on with you and Triss.
   1123824|00000000||No, I-- I mean--
   1123829|00000000||Now, I cannot say I'm not tempted to, hm, intervene, but… I believe I'll let it lie this time.
   1123834|00000000||Seems so.
   1123832|00000000||How about that? You came here to fumble your way through an explanation, yet instead of enjoying the show, I went and did your job for you.
   1123836|00000000||But now, enough of this maudlin business. We've something to do, remember?
   1123810|00000000||Quite the opposite. But the other moments would have been more intense as well.
   1123808|00000000||Think we would've argued less?
   1123812|00000000||Moments like this.
   1123822|00000000||Why, so you can ask me if we can remain friends, despite all?
   1123820|00000000||Yen, can we talk?
    393484|00000000||Ye never know with that lot. Right, well, I head south soon. Haven't looked there yet. Fare ye well. We might meet again someday.
    422532|00000000||Greetings. Wanna look over our stock?
    422536|00000000||Sure, if you can afford it. The Jarl's a stickler for quality so we keep no rubbish here.
    425869|00000000||Let's go, next.
    421762|00000000||Let me look at your goods.
    421256|00000000||Welcome to the Sacred Grove.
    432288|00000000||*Sniff* Earthy scent from the bear's maw. Something towards… mushrooms?
    435862|00000000||And I know the lass lives. I'm sure of it. When the blood of Riannon's daughters is shed, the sea grows white with fury. I'd mark such a storm.
    456846|00000000||Blood and mushrooms… Think we can find out where this barrel came from? Looks different.
    478808|00000000||You can't help me track him… So I don't see any reason for you to go down there.
    522527|00000000||There's no curse to speak of. Cerys has decided she must match Hjalmar and sought out a deed worthy of a queen.
    349118|00000000||You're lucky. I'm not exactly known for being forgiving.
    550947|00000000||A fine beauty, golden-haired and ruddy-cheeked…
    577798|00000000||Tain't somethin' I usually do… but it wouldn't be right to turn down a traveler.
    594822|00000000||Take your gold, go, and keep away from our lands.
   1007278|00000000||Right. Fine. Good. Glad we've got that over with. We know where we stand, at least.
   1001474|00000000||See it? The razorback... clear up high?
   1017442|00000000||Yeah, like when we were looking for the golden dragon and an avalanche swept us off the trail?
   1018417|00000000||It was, in a way. Besides… once you say "I love you," a kiss has to taste differently.
   1034968|00000000||Two brothers, Askel and Nilas. Went out to hunt, turned into prey. Wounds so horrible even I went weak in the knees when they brought them in. And I've seen my share of bloody harm - been on thirty-two raids, from Poviss to the mountains of--
   1056454|00000000||No mushrooms.
   1064467|00000000||Forgotten already? An omelet with peppers, mushroom and onion. Thank you.
    529619|00000000||Thought we were opening up, having an honest talk… But fine, let's continue pretending everything's just peachy.
    532009|00000000||Heard the words before, haven't you?
    531124|00000000||Nah… Just a bit… hungover.
   1074552|00000000||Ye know it ain't on my map.
   1127063|00000000||You know… once it's all over, I'm going to Kovir.
   1127066|00000000||Not sure if you've heard, but… once it's all over, I'm going to Kovir.
   1127064|00000000||Need your advice. It's about Yennefer.
   1127070|00000000||Mhm.
   1127068|00000000||With Triss.
   1127041|00000000||Tsk… a bit. But you can't let it bother you.
   1127046|00000000||And?
   1127044|00000000||You know, folk would stare at the scar on my cheek, always. It used to upset me greatly.
   1127049|00000000||The mark on my face look bad?
   1127048|00000000||I started undoing one shirt button more. Problem solved.
   1127090|00000000||The first roadside inn you pass. Take her there. Pay for a month in advance, carve "Do not disturb" into the room door and shut it behind you.
   1127088|00000000||You've been almost everywhere. Also know Yen well. Any ideas? I was thinking Spalla, or maybe Dol Blathanna…?
   1127094|00000000||Just like that.
   1127092|00000000||Huh. Just like that?
   1127074|00000000||Or maybe I'll finally hang up my swords.
   1127072|00000000||Interesting part of the world. Perhaps you'll get a contract for some rare snow beast. A barbegazi, or a vendigo… Or a, uh, an amarok.
   1127078|00000000||Better.
   1127076|00000000||It's that good with her?
   1127083|00000000||Very well. Ask away.
   1127081|00000000||So… need your advice. About Yennefer.
   1127086|00000000||Thing is… I'd like to take her somewhere. Once it's over. Someplace… picturesque, beautiful, even. Where we can rest.
   1127038|00000000||The mark on my face - is it noticeable? Hard on the eyes?
   1123858|00000000||Seemed to take that pretty well.
   1123863|00000000||Haven't been here in a while, have you?
   1123860|00000000||Or wants us to think she did.
   1123867|00000000||Mhm. The bed… it, uh, broke.
   1123865|00000000||Too long. How's the guest room? Anything changed?
   1123869|00000000||Not a problem. We'll sleep on the floor. Spread out a hide and…
   1123843|00000000||Would you like a moment to yourselves?
   1123846|00000000||Sorry, we didn't mean to--
   1123850|00000000||Only if you really don't mind…
   1123849|00000000||No, let's go.
   1123848|00000000||I know. It's a simple question. Do you want some time alone?
   1123855|00000000||Long as you really don't mind…
   1123852|00000000||No… let's go. They're waiting.
   1123889|00000000||Fine. So a minute, then we go, all right?
   1123894|00000000||Forty-five seconds.
   1123892|00000000||Hm. This is just a little awkward…
   1123898|00000000||We've forty-five seconds left. Well, thirty, now. And then we throw the gauntlet at the Wild Hunt. So I beg you, use these seconds well.
   1123896|00000000||Huh?
   1123903|00000000||Hm. No points for creativity. But for your candor…
   1123901|00000000||Yen, I adore you.
   1123874|00000000||Guess we should go.
   1123872|00000000||Ahem.
   1123878|00000000||I-- Maybe I'll give you two a moment.
   1123883|00000000||No. We'd better all go now.
   1123882|00000000||No, no. You must've missed each other terribly, A minute's delay won't hurt anyone.
   1123880|00000000||Triss, please…
   1123886|00000000||No, we should get going. They're waiting for us.
   1123884|00000000||Fine. A minute, then we go.
   1123906|00000000||Time to go.
   1061316|00000000||Hm… oh, so be it. But we, uh, really ought to go back to Kate's. It's unwise to linger in the street.
   1059926|00000000||This is it? Hmm… Boulder was plugging the well until recently.
   1124126|00000000||Worked out nicely, don't you think?
   1124147|00000000||Me too.
   1124145|00000000||You know… perhaps it's not my concern, but… I'm glad you and Yennefer have ended up together.
   1124151|00000000||Hm. Guess we both needed a while to grapple with it.
   1124149|00000000||You took your time.
   1124153|00000000||So what was it like? You know, when the wish lost its hold. What did you feel?
   1124158|00000000||But what?
   1124130|00000000||You and Triss. Never expected it, to be honest.
   1124128|00000000||What're you talking about?
   1124134|00000000||So, how did the two of you--?
   1124132|00000000||Life's full of surprises.
   1124138|00000000||Hmm. With Yen it was fight after fight, lots of arguments, drama… Not saying it was bad, but…
   1124136|00000000||End up together?
   1124141|00000000||Got to be exhausting. With Triss, it's not. I finally feel…  harmony. A calm. Feel like things are the way they're supposed to be.
   1124162|00000000||And felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. At long last.
   1124161|00000000||Hmm. Well, there we were, the two of us, on the mountain top. I looked at her, and…
    555570|00000000||Stop interrupting! I have to focus.
    561710|00000000||Let's meet on the Oxenfurt Bridge.
